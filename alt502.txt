A second theory states that it is based on the colors of the primitive coat of arms of Christopher Columbus, and lastly, a third theory says that it is based on the colors of the uniforms of the Burgerwache in Hamburg. The first theory is based in a letter, where Miranda describes a conversation with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about its Theory of colours at a party hosted in the city of Weimar in 1785. The santeños Patriots took this model to represent Los Santos in 1821 in the battle to gain independence from Spain.

But in the 1910s Dr. Manuel Segundo Sánchez, director of the National Library of Caracas, challenged the notion that the tricolour had been flown as the naval flag of Leander. At the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, Sanchez had uncovered correspondence of the Spanish colonial authorities which included a facsimile drawing of a naval flag used by Miranda in 1806. It was a blue banner with a sun and a moon – in Sanchez's interpretation, the blue colour would represent both sky and sea, whilst the rising sun would represent the rising American liberty and the full moon of the declining Spanish empire.
