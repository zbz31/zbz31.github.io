Design
Richmond’s flag has a field of dark blue on its upper twothirds. The lower third is divided into four horizontal stripes of white, red, white, and red, in proportions of 1:3:1:3. In the center of the blue field is a three-quarter silhouette of a bareheaded boatman in white, standing with his right leg slightly raised as if it rests on a seat, and poling his boat toward the hoist. The white boat melds with the top white stripe, which has four slight bumps resembling waves and thus gives the appearance of water. In a three-quarters circle around the boatman are 9 five-pointed white stars (were the circle closed, there would be 12 stars). The boatman and stars occupy just slightly less than half the total field.
John M Purcell, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003

Symbolism
The city describes the symbolism in “Richmond and Its Flag”:
The faceless boatman, as he poles to the honor side of the flag, symbolizes the tens of thousands of anonymous individuals, composed of a multiplicity of nationalities and races, who through the ages determined Richmond’s homogeneous character and contributed to the City’s success, growth and progress. Surrounding this symbol of our river’s power is an arc of nine stars. Each represents a present state that was once part of the Commonwealth of Virginia over which Richmond was their capital in the nation’s infancy— Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
The city’s colors, red and blue, date to 1784 when the mayor, Robert Mitchell, added strips of red and blue ribbon when he affixed the city seal to documents. When asked why, he responded, “The blue signifies the river from which all life flows, and the red is for the infernal red clay that is always under our feet.” Richmond is situated on the James River.

Design
The field of Olympia’s flag is white. In the hoist half is the city’s ovoid logo, about 1 unit high and 1.5 units wide on a field of 2:3 units. The logo is divided more or less in half horizontally. The upper half shows Washington’s state capitol toward the fly against snow-capped mountains in the background toward the hoist. A blue sky fills in the top of the logo behind the mountain peak and capitol dome. A chartreuse sward runs from the capitol to the hoist in front of the mountains. Across the center of the logo in front of the capitol is a swath of bluish green suggesting the capitol grounds. Below, in the remainder of the logo, is a section depicting water in two shades of blue—across an azure blue field, two pairs of dark blue parallel lines, one near the top and the other near the bottom, running horizontally to suggest ripples on the water. On the fly half of the field is centered City of over OLYMPIA, in slightly larger letters, all in dark blue.

Design
Charleston’s flag has a border of blue with a coat of arms in the center on a light field, perhaps in imitation of the West Virginia state flag. However, the field in Charleston’s flag is bright yellow instead of white and the shade of the blue border is lighter than on the state flag. Above the shield of the arms is a red scroll with CHARLESTON in black. Surrounding the lower half of the shield are various green leaves, predominantly oak leaf clusters. The shield is set on a decorative framework of descending lines, creating the effect of a fringed trumpet banner. In the topmost part of the shield appears the dome of the state capitol in blue and yellow with MDCCXCIV (1794 in Roman numerals) in blue. The arms are quartered. In the first quarter (upper hoist corner), a crossed rifle and arrow appear in yellow on a green field. In the second quarter is a sternwheeler in yellow on blue. The third quarter shows a pick and shovel, yellow on black. The fourth quarter contains a yellow cog, looking very much like a flower, on a red field.
Richard Monahan, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003

Symbolism
The capitol dome refers to Charleston’s status as the capital of West Virginia. The crossed rifle and arrow recall the city’s frontier heritage and its beginnings as a fort in the French and Indian War. The paddleboat represents the role of shipping in Charleston’s economy and its location at the juncture of two rivers. The pick and shovel are those of a coal miner, emphasizing the importance of mining to West Virginia. The black color further stresses the role of coal in the Charleston economy. The cogwheel reflects the city’s industries as well as its former nickname as “the Cog City”. The leaves surrounding the lower half of the shield may be for the love of nature of the city’s inhabitants.

4/3/2025 13:58:05,[GBR] British civil air ensign,"The British civil air ensign is the flag that may be flown at civil aviation establishments in the United Kingdom and be displayed on UK-registered civil aircraft. It should be flown at civilian air facilities as the national flag in place of the Union flag.[1]

The ensign's field is light blue and has a dark blue Saint George's cross which is fimbriated white placed overall. The Union flag is in the canton.

The civil air ensign was instituted by an Order in Council on 11 August 1931. The order stated that ""An ensign called the Civil Air Ensign is the proper national colour to be flown by aircraft and air transport undertakings and at aerodromes."" The first civil air ensign to be flown in London was hoisted by Mrs Victor Bruce, the noted British woman aviator.[2]

The 1931 Order was revoked by the Civil Air Ensign Order made on 18 March 1937 additionally permitting the use of the flag on buildings used by the Ministry of Civil Aviation or air transport undertakings, on vehicles used personally by the minister and by any person given special permission by the minister.[3]


The tail of a de Havilland Tiger Moth showing the civil air ensign on the rudder.
The prototype flag had been made up in silk and was kept throughout World War II by the Civil Aviation Department in a series of locations in London. In October 1948 it was handed to the Ministry of Civil Aviation Library for retention and display. The visible stains on the light blue silk were said to have been caused by water from the fire brigade's hoses used in quelling a fire in the roof at Parliament Square House, caused by a German incendiary bomb, whilst the CAD was accommodated there.[3]

In 1957, a ministry working party reviewing the Air Navigation Order concluded that it was anomalous to regulate the use of the civil air ensign when no special regulations were required to control the use of its maritime equivalent, the Red Ensign. All mention of the civil air ensign was therefore omitted from the Air Navigation Order 1960.[3]

It was part of the livery, as the tail logo, of the Civil Aviation Flying Unit (CAFU) and its predecessors from 1944 to 1982. In 1982 the last two HS 748s were repainted in a CAA corporate blue and white scheme and the civil air ensign was replaced by the Union Flag. The ensign next appeared on the fin of HS 125-700 registration G-UKCA operated by the Civil Aviation Authority from 1987 to 1992 and subsequently by HS 125-700 G-OCAA until 2002.

The British civil air ensign is also the basis for several versions used by other countries.",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/g/gb_ca.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_civil_air_ensign#/media/File:Civil_Air_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg,Civil Ensign,1931,4,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Blue, Red, White",Blue,"Blue, White",(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_civil_air_ensign,u/Geogrartist,United Kingdom

The White Ensign is also worn by yachts of members of the Royal Yacht Squadron and by ships of Trinity House escorting the reigning monarch.

In addition to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George's Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the Royal Irish Yacht Club wear a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the Heraldic Badge of Ireland.

The evolution of the Blue Ensign followed that of the Union Jack. The ensign originated in the 17th century with the St George's Cross (the Flag of England) in the canton, and with a blue field.

The Acts of Union 1707 united England (which included present day Wales) with Scotland in the Kingdom of Great Britain, thus producing a new Blue Ensign with the new Union Flag, containing a saltire, in the canton. With the Act of Union 1800, Ireland became a part of the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and St Patrick's Cross was incorporated into the Union Flag and, accordingly, into the cantons of all British ensigns from 1 January 1801.",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/g/gb-bluen.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ensign#/media/File:Government_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg,Ensign,"1620, 1801, 1864, ",0,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Blue, Red, White",Blue,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ensign,u/Geogrartist,United Kingdom

The First Flag was adopted by Country-Order of 19 November 1959, and had six stars. One star was dropped because Aruba left in 1986.
The centre of the topmost and bottommost stars are located at two imaginary horizontal lines. The first line at one-sixth of the height of the blue stripe under the upper edge of the blue stripe, the second line at one-sixth of the height of the blue stripe above the lower edge of the blue stripe. The centre of the topmost star is located at the centre of the first imaginary line. The centres of the bottommost stars are located on the second imaginary line at such a way, that an isosceles triangle is formed with the centre of the topmost star, with an angle of 45 degrees at the top. The centre of the leftmost star is located by forming another isosceles triangle with the centre of the topmost star and the centre of the left star at the bottom, again with an angle of 45 degrees at the top.

3/24/2025 12:14:32,[GER] Kingdom of Hanover (1814-1837),"On a red field a white horse. Illustrated in Wilson 1986 p. 70. Reported as Royal Flag 1842, 1848 and 1862.
Norman Martin, 1 Mar 1998

According to the Hannoverian monarchists' website, prior to the end of the union with Great Britain in 1837, the running red horse (the banner of arms of Hannover proper), was often unofficially used as Hannoverian flag. According to the material, this was normally with a green field under the rear legs, but I find this surprising since every version of the Hannoverian arms that I can recall has this field - recall that it formed part of the British coat of arms since George I - has the horse without the green field.
Norman Martin, 26 June 2000

According to H. Grote, Geschichte der Welfischen Stammwappen, Leipzig 1863, until 1727 Hannover (House of Braunschweig-Lüneburg) used the flag with the white horse - often erroneously depicted as a pegasus. Thereafter the British flag was used with the horse. The old flag never came out of use however and was officially tolerated again during the French occupation of the Hannover harbours 1810-1813 when the British flag was forbidden.

The design was formally adopted in 1908 and was flown at every lifeboat station thereafter.

The design of the flag has changed twice to reflect changing royal patronage.

The banner is flown to signify the presence of the monarch. It may be flown when they are present at one of their residences, from the car, ship, or aeroplane they are travelling in, and from any building they are visiting. The banner is never flown at half-mast, as a symbol of the continuity of the monarchy, and also as there is always a sovereign on the throne.

The flag is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and black with a golden Hawk of Quraish placed on the center on the white stripe.[1][2][3]

The flag was abandoned in Libya in 1977 after Muammar Gaddafi established the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and adopted a green flag.

Egypt and Syria continued to still used the flag of the Federation of Arab Republics until the early 1980s. Syria adopted the former United Arab Republic flag in 1980 and Egypt in 1984.[4] Syria continued to use the 1980 flag until 2024.",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/s/sy-1972.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Federation_of_Arab_Republics#/media/File:Flag_of_Syria_(1972%E2%80%931980).svg,Historical,1972,3,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,"Yes, and it is a bird",,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Red, Yellow, White",Equal Distribution,"Black, Red, White",Red,White,Black,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Federation_of_Arab_Republics,u/Geogrartist,Syria

3/21/2025 12:22:11,[.] Vegan Flag,"The creation of the international Vegan Flag was announced on 2017-06-09 [1, 2]. It was created by the vegan activist Gad Hakimi, a designer from Israel, with the online assistance from a number of vegan activists from several countries [1, 2]. The flag displays a white inverted chevron between three triangles, the one within the chevron in green and the other two in blue. These colors symbolize the connection of humanity to the animals represented by their natural habitats: blue stands for the sea and air, green for the land and white for unity [2]. The flag has quickly spread worldwide: there are examples of its use in Israel [3, 4, 5], United Kingdom [6], California [3, 7], Croatia [3, 8] and the Philippines [3, 9]. It was also flown by the mountaineers at the mountain peaks, such as the Himlung Himal mountain in the Himalaya range [10] and the Elbrus mountain in the Caucasus range [11], as well as used at the LGBT-related events, such as the Belgrade Pride 2018 in Serbia [12] and the Equality Parade 2023 in Warsaw, Poland [13].

3/21/2025 3:12:27,[BOL] Wiphala,"The Wiphala flag is described by the constitution of Bolivia as one of Bolivia's national symbols, and is commonly called the ""dual flag"" of Bolivia. However, it is most closely associated with the indigenous peoples of the former Incan Empire, and descends from the Wiphala of Qullasuyu, an Incan province approximately coterminous with Bolivia. It has, starting in the late 90s, found use in pro-indigenous political movements, and first gained prominence when the indigenous Aymara politician Evo Morales was elected president of Bolivia.

The indigenous Bolivian Katarista Movement describes the following symbolism for the colors of the flag, promoted by the Bolivian government.

    Red: The Earth and the Andean man
    Orange: Society and culture
    Yellow: Energy and strength
    White: Time and change
    Green: Natural resources and wealth

3/20/2025 14:46:20,[AUS] Lord Howe Island,"The Flag of Lord Howe Island
The history, heritage and topography of Lord Howe Island were the inspiration for the design of this Pacific islands beautiful flag.

The golden sun alludes to the warmth and friendliness of the islanders and the silver rays are seen shimmering on the crystal blue waters of the surrounding Pacific Ocean. Silhouetted against the sun we find the striking features of the island.

Discovered in 1778 by Lt Henry Lidgbird Ball of HMS Supply, the Island was named in honour of Admiral Of The Fleet, Lord Howe. It is Lord Howe's Command Flag, which flew victoriously during the ""Glorious First of June Battle"", in 1794, that forms the basis of the design of the Island's flag. Consequently, the rays of the sun also depict the crosses of St George and St Andrew.

Admiral Lord Howe was instrumental in developing a sophisticated Royal Navy system of code flags for signalling messages. This system was the fore-runner to today's ""international Code"" and included the ""Blue Peter""",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/a/au-lhi.gif,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_Island#/media/File%3AFlag_of_Lord_Howe_Island.svg,Island,???,4,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Blue, Yellow, White",Blue,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_Island,u/Geogrartist,Australia

3/18/2025 22:18:07,[USA] Rainbow Beehive Flag,"Rainbow Beehive Flag is the LGBTQ+ version of the new state flag of Utah. It was created by Michael Green of the Flags For Good flag manufacturing company, by replacing the bottom red field with a six-striped rainbow pattern arranged vertically [1]. The red of the rainbow pattern is lighter than the red of the state flag; the flag also employs two shades of blue, as the one in the rainbow pattern is lighter than the one of the top field. The flag is still not widely used: the only photo currently available online was taken in Herriman, Utah on 2023-05-31 [2].

3/18/2025 22:12:17,[USA] Wyoming Gay Flag,"The Wyoming gay flag is derived from the state flag by repainting the bison into rainbow colors, with red at the top and in the same shade as the flag border, while blue is lighter than the flag field. The flag is currently shown in Greg Gomes' collection of gay flags images: www.gayjourney.com/flags/gay_flags_state.htm, and, unlike most images, is not marked as his creation. All other sources seam to repeat that image. While this might have also been true for Chris Pinette's website: www.pinette.net/chris/flags/gay/index.html, there is also his statement that he had seen the real flag in San Francisco. The earliest capture of this page at Internet Archive dates from 2000-05-23, so the flag must have already been in use during the 1990s, but must have also fallen out of use since then, having been replaced by the Rainbow Flag and other simpler designs.

Amongst the worker's complaints were that they were being forced to work 93 hours a week and were not allowed to leave the premises between shifts. Upon declaration of the soviet, a red flag was flown over the building. In response armed police were sent to remove the workers, however, they had barricaded themselves inside. The operators of the Asylum were forced to negotiate with the workers. Workers won a 56-hour week and a pay rise for both male and female staff. A further concession was that married staff were to be allowed go home after their shifts ended. It was eventually disestablished on 4 February of the same year.

The exact origins of the arms are obscure due to the records being lost in a fire. Some believe that the 'castle and ship' element on the shield is derived from the arms of Bristol, in the same way as the 13th century Dublin seal. Others feel that the castle represents Saint Laurence Gate, while the ship stands for the river Boyne and Drogheda port. The 'star and crescent' emblem has the same origin as the coat of arms of Portsmouth and is taken from the arms of Richard I of England (Lionheart) who adopted it during the Third Crusade. The three lions 'passant guardant' are also derived from Richard I who began to use the emblem in 1198 to represent his position as King of the English, Duke of the Normans and Duke of the Aquitaines. These emblems honour the king, during whose reign Drogheda was granted its charter in 1194 by Hugh de Lacy.

3/12/2025 1:40:28,[ROM] Romania 1989 Revolutionary Flag,"The ""holey"" flag was one of the most important flags in the recent history of the country. This flag was a de facto civil ensign of Romania immediately after the fall of Ceausescu, and is historically important to the point of being offered to the president of the US, being thanked by him as a beautiful ""poncho"".
Jorge Candeias, 25 May 1998

If we extend your logics a little further, is it possible that the hole borders followed the irregularities of the coat of arms? Or was it just a regular oval? From what I remember from these days*, the holes were ""just a regular oval"", the easiest way to do this. During these several days we had no TV program on or national TV, but it was whole the time re-broadcasting the ""Free Romania TV"" that followed the revolution. I remember lots of the flags seen then - and to my best memory they were all oval. However, memory is not a good proof - anyone have some photos from the time?
Željko Heimer, 31 May 1998

I wrote to the White House when the President was presented with the Romanian Flag with the hole in it and the answer I got was that it was not an original flag but a newly made Romanian flag with an oval hole in the center that is hemmed so that the hole will not grow bigger with use! They didn't say, but maybe this is a tourist souvenir in Bucharest!
David Martucci, 27 May1998

I concur with the opinion which is based on the belief that the use of the Romanian flag with a hole was merely because there was no easily obtainable flag without the Communist arms. First, all flags would have been manufactured with the arms in them. This was the law of Romania. Second, I would not think that people could not easily go to the store and buy blue, yellow, and red cloth when a forcible change in government was at hand. Third, the easiest flag to obtain would be a current version; however, to distance themselves from the Ceausescu regime, they would simply remove the arms by cutting them out.

As far as the flag presented to Clinton, I would like to thank Dave Martucci for his actual follow up. Such a gift would be merely a nice gesture toward the US by Romania. Also, I have a friend who used to live in Timosoara, Romania, and now lives in Bucharest. He has sent me a Romanian flag (no hole), but he has not mentioned seeing one with a hole for sale to tourists.

To sum up, I don't believe it matters whether the flag has a circular or oval hole. The fact was that such a flag was used to distance the people from Communism. Also, the flag with the hole was never official. It was a de facto flag of the people. When the people could officially decide, they returned to the plain blue-yellow-red flag.
Calvin Paige Herring, 30 May 1998

During the Revolution people used standard flags bearing the communist coat of arms but, as noted there, they cut out the coat of arms as an act of rebellion against the communism regime. Indeed people could have easily manufactured normal red-yellow-blue flags from normal cloth in the stores, but the Revolution for the vast majority of the people was a spontaneous movement. Few had the presence of spirit to plan anything in advance, the masses moved in the streets without much preparation. While there is no doubt that certain political circles did plan a coup d'etat in advance, the planning certainly did not include the mass manufacturing of normal flags and their distribution to the revolutionary masses. Shortly after, when the regime was overtaken and when such capabilities were available, indeed the holey flag was used further on as a symbol of the revolution, because so many of the population carried such flags in the uprising.
George Barbarosie, 27 October 2003

During the 1989 anti-communist revolution in Romania, from 17 December on, the people started to rip off the socialist coat of arms of Romania from the flags. In fact, any symbol of the communism they caught was destroyed in one way or another in those days. Decree-Law nr. 2 from 27 December 1989 regarding the establishment, organization and functioning of the Council of the National Salvation Front and the territorial councils of the National Salvation Front, on article 1 ruled that ""the flag of the country is the traditional tricolor of Romania, having the color stripes placed vertically, in the following order from the hoist: blue, yellow, red"".

The flag was introduced in 2016 by Sanca Veneta (""Venetian Left"" in Venetian), an independentist organization, which seems to use it outside the LGBT-related events as well (together with other Venetian flags), but the LGBT people seem to have come to use it regardless of their individual political attitudes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The middle arms are similar to the lesser arms with a mural crown added above. The crown has three fortified towers, the middle one above the gate. The diadem is ornamented with rubies and pearls.
The greater arms, the most solemn ones, are surrounded by branches of oak tied with a ribbon.

In 1999, the new Municipal Statutes Statut Občine Piran (text) were adopted on 1 April 1999 and published on 20 April 1999 in Uradne objave Primorske novice, 10/1999. Nothing was changed regarding the municipal symbols.
The same year, Decision Odlok o spremembah in dopolnitvah odloka o izobešanju zastav, dvojezičnih napisih in zunanjem videzu naselij v Občini Piran (text), adopted on 20 May 1999 and published on 22 June 1999 in Uradne objave Primorske novice, 18/1999, superseded a previous Decision from the 1980s on the use of flag of the Italian minority. I assume that the previous Decision prescribed the use of the Italian flag with the red star. The new Decision prescribes that the flag of the Italian minority should be used with a streamer in the Slovene national colours, leaving to the Italian minority the choice of its flag.
In 2000, Decision Odlok o izobešanju zastav v občini Piran (text), adopted on 28 September 2000 and published on 3 November 2000 in Uradne objave Primorske novice,41/2000, superseded the previous texts concerning the flags; the streamer was no longer prescribed.

The flag of Piran is rectangular, in proportions 1:2, horizontally divided red-blue with the municipal coat of arms set near the hoist in the middle of the red stripe. On photographies of this flag taken by Doug Julien in August 2002 on the main square of Piran, the coat of arms is much closer to the hoist than officially prescribed.
On photographies of the vertical flag taken by Doug Julien, the flag is much longer than 1:2.

It gained popularity among the SETI researchers and is flown at numerous SETI research facilities around the world. Notably, the flag flies at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory, in Delaware, Ohio. On 23 December 1996, in honour of the death of Carl Sagan, three days prior, the flag had been flown there at the half-mast.
The flag was originally distributed by Earth Flag Co. International, which was founded by Cadle. The design had entered the public domain in 2003.

2/28/2025 13:34:01,"[AUT] [CRO] Triune Kingdom of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia, (1867-1918)","The flag of this design was mass produced (manufactured by printing on textile) in Zagreb around 1894. A copy is preserved in the Croatian Historical Museum. In use since 1867, the flag was adopted in 1868.
The flag was prescribed with more detail on 19 June 1876, by the Croatian-Hungarian Agreement of 1868, and by an Edict of 16 September 1876. The crown above the shield should be the St. Stephen's Crown. The Edict of 20 December 1899 detemines an inverted order of the Croatian and Dalmatian coats of arms in regard to the 1876 Edict, stating that the worlds ""left"" and ""right"" should be understood in heraldic manner.

The Croatian-Hungarian Agreement (Nagodba) that followed a similar agreement between Austria and Hungary (Ausgleich) says:

61. In the autonomous affairs within the borders of the Kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia should be used the united colors and coats of arms of these Kingdoms, surmounted by the Crown of St. Stephen.
62. When signifying the affairs common to all the Kingdoms of the Hungarian crown should be used the united coats of arms of the Kingdoms of Hungary and Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia.
63. In discussion of common affairs, on the buildings in which the common Parliament of the Hungarian Crown Lands is held should be flown togther with the Hungarian flag also the united flag of the Kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia.
On 21 November 1914, the Vice-Roy of the Kingdoms of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia issued Decree No. 8378, related with the usage of flags and emblems:

Since during the time became a custom in the Kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia to use flags that are not adequate either in state-juridical or in political sense. So, because except of the Decree No. 231 of 8 April 1885 of the Imperial and Royal High Command in Zagreb, which was naturally issued only for the former military frontier, there are not general regulations for usage of flags, I order:
1. According to ¤ 61 Article I from the 1868 Agreement and to Decree No. 18.307 of 16 November 1867 of the Department of the Interior of the Royal Country Government, the red-white-blue tricolor is the civil flag in the Kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia, which with the united coat of arms of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia with the crown of St. Stephen on top is the official flag for usage in autonomous affairs. The aforementioned civil flag may be used by everyone in an appropriate way.
2. Besides, as it was stated in the mentioned Decree of the Imperial and Royal High Command, it is allowed to everyone to use in proper way in public celebration occasions the red-white-green Hungarian tricolour and the black-yellow Austrian flag. Furthermore, at special occasions, the authorities allow usage of recognised flags and coats of arms of County and Town Municipalities, Free and Royal Towns, administrative and noble communities and some noble families.
3. Usage of flags of other countries and of other civil or political flags is not allowed. Exceptionally, local authority may allow usage of flag of foreign sovereigns and countries in special occasions in honor of a sovereign, amember of ruling house or a representative of foreign friendly country, or to that country itself. The same rules apply to every other usage of colors and emblems of foreign countries.
This Decree does not interfere with the right of persons protected by international law to use the flag of the country that they are representative of.
4. Public corporations, civil societies and guilds and private societies must use only flags that are approved by authority.
5. Police authorities shall punish violations of this Decree with a fine of 2 to 200 K or with arrest from 6 hours to 14 days and confiscate the unauthorized flag or emblem.
6. This Decree is valid from the day of proclamation.
This means that only the coat of arms of the Triune Kingdom with the crown of St. Stephen was an official emblem of the country. This applied only in Croatia and Slavonia, since Dalmatia was at that time in Austrian part (subject to change). The arms were in use until 29 October 1918, when Croatia left from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In Croatia and Slavonia this emblem can be seen on many contemporary buildings, mostly for administrative or educational purpose, but also on the roof of the St. Marc parish church located in Zagreb Upper Town, between the Parliament and the Viceroy's Palace.
However, there were many variations of the official version, even with another type of crown, since many people did not liked the Hungarian rule, or without any crown. There were also many types of shields. There were no any extra add-ons, only some times branches of olive and oak were represented on each side of arms.

The unnofficial coat of arms was indeed the prefered design; probably, its widespread use boosted the Viceroy to issue the Decree quoted above. A very similar design can be seen in Mayers Konversation Lexikon from 1897, where the coats of arms are credited to Ströhl, the leading Austrian heraldist of the time.

2/28/2025 12:41:03,"[AUT] [CRO] Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia (1848-1867)","In 1848 the tricolor, based on the colors of the coat of arms, was first used as a flag. The coat of arms was often set in the middle, in various artistical renditions. This flag remained the Croatian national flag ever since, though it was not unfrequently prohibited by various regimes. For example, it was prohibitied between 1852 and 1860.

A drawing representing the Slavic barricade in Vienna, 1848 (image), Croatian Historical Museum), is considered to be the first documented use of the Croatian tricolour.

A painting by Dragutin Weingärtner (photo), 1885, entitled ""The Session of the Croatian Assembly in 1848"", is kept in the Varaždin Town Museum. The flag hoisted there is a tricolor with the coat of arms of the Triune Kingdom. A postage stamp issued on 25 March 1998, of face value 1.60 HRK, shows the painting.

The Varaždin Town Museum keeps a rare example of a preserved Croatian tricolor from 1848 or some years afterwards. The flag (photo) is a simple, almost square tricolor without any additional symbols. It may be one of the flags used in 1848 to ornament streets when Viceroy Jelačić visited Varaždin on 7 September 1848, on his way from Zagreb towards Hungary to quell the uprising there.

Proportion7:10. What is this flag used for and when ?
Nozomi Kariyasu, 21 January 2001

This flag is a Hungarian flag with the small Coat of Arms, which was the only official Coat of Arms between 1920-1938. This flag could be used 1882-1918 and 1920-1946. The angels show that this flag is a Roman Catholic version.
István Molnár, 18 Febuary 2001

Does that means that there were several variations of the Coat of Arms used at the same time differing in small elements regarding the religious preferences (of those who use the arms?).
Željko Heimer, 20 Febuary 2001

The upper flag is the Hungarian kingdom flag according to an U.K.Admilalty book published in 1918. According to Wappenlexikon by Christian Siemer, this Coat of Arms of hu was used 1848 - 8 November 1868 and July 1919 - 1947 while Coat of Arms of the second flag was used 15 October 1915 - March 1919
Nozomi Kariyasu, 10 March 2001 and 24 June 2001

What was the use of this flag during the Second World War?
Flaggenbuch shows as national flag the Hungarian tricolor with lesser arms (the shield with the St. Stephen's crown), as 'national ensign, also used as service ensign. The tricolor ensign without any arms is also shown, as 'national ensign without arms'. Flaggenbuch shows also the 'middle' arms ('Mittleres' Staatswappen), similar to Nozmoi's design but with slightly different angels (especially ""facing"" the flag viewer) in the middle of a white field with the wolftooth border as 'Standard des Reichwefers'.
Ivan Sache, 11 March 2001

I don't know this flag. I think if somebody use this flag it never was official. The 'Middle Coat of Arms' was used on white flag with wolfteeth. This version of the Middle Coat of Arms - which contains the shield of Bosnia (bottom left yellow) was in use in 1915-1918 and 1938-1944 (only on war flags). The Middle Coat of Arms without the Bosnian shield was in use in 1882-1915. The Hungarian national flag 1882-1918 was the red-white-green without Coat of Arms. 1919-1944 with or without the Little Coat of Arms. This Coat of Arms is not the Kossuth Coat of Arms!!
István Molnár, 11 March 2001

Last summer, when my family went to Budapest and London, they bought me a replica of this flag, with the fly end fringed...  Only difference between the design pictured here and my flag is that my flag has the entire Coat of Arms (shield, Holy Crown and angels) all contained inside the white stripe. 
If the RC version had angels, what other versions were there?  I'm assuming there was a ""Református"" version as well...
Georges G. Kovari, 21 March 2001

The Coat of Arms may be applied.  On the white field, or spread on the three fields?  I didn't find a rule.  The angelic variation is at present unofficial.
Somewhere I found some information about how from 1882 on two variations were acceptable for the Coat of Arms (small and middle arms): The Catholic with angels, the Protestant with olive and oak sprigs. My comment concerns to the flag with the small Coat of Arms , not the flag with the middle Coat of Arms.
István Molnár, 21 March 2001

In 1849-1867 Hungary was under direct Austrian controll. Didn't use Hungarian symbols. In 1867-1882 used the small Coat of Arms (on flag) and a middle Coat of Arms (small Coat of Arms in the heart of the shield around the Dalmatian, Croatian, Sclavonian and Transylvanian Coat of Arms). 1882-1915 used the small Coat of Arms (on flag) and a middle Coat of Arms (small Coat of Arms in the heart of the shield around the Dalmatian, Croatian, Sclavonian and Transylvanian Coat of Arms and Fiume's Coat of Arms too!!!). In 1915-1918 used the small Coat of Arms (on flag), and the Middle Coat of Arms (small Coat of Arms in the heart of the shield around the Dalmatian, Croatian, Sclavonian and Transylvanian Fiume's Coat of Arms and Bosnian Coat of Arms too - on flag. Between November 1918 and March 1919 used only the small Coat of Arms without crown (Kossuth Coat of Arms). Between March1919 - August 1919 didn't used Coat of Arms, but red star. Between August 1919 and 1920 used the small Coat of Arms with or without crown. In 1920-1946 used the small Coat of Arms with angels or olive branches on flag. All flags were the red-white-green tricolour (Ratio of the Hungarian tricolour is 2:1 from 1848 not 3:2).
Countries on the used Coat of Arms:
1848-1849 small   Hungary
1848-1849 middle  Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Transylvania
1849-1860 no Coat of Arms

At <www.trianon.hu> there are photos from a ceremony that was held on 4th June 2001. This flag (close-up on the Coat of Arms here) relates to the Treaty of Trianon (1920) and the detached territories. The original flag was in the Szabadság (Liberty) Square between1928-1944.

2/28/2025 12:22:09,[AUT] Habsburg Monarchy (1282-1918),"Since the days of Rudolph of Habsburg and the 1283 Treaty of Rheinfelden, the combination of red-white-red was widely considered to be the Austrian (later also Inner Austrian) colours used by the ruling Habsburg dynasty. Black and gold later became the colours used by the Imperial House of Habsburg when they held the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as they did from the mid-15th century all the way to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and were themselves derived from the banner of the empire.[1] The original form of this flag featured a gold background with a black double-headed eagle. However, this proved to be a complicated design, and was hard to reproduce. In the 18th century, a simpler form with black and gold bars started to appear in the lands ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor. With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, this flag was approved for use as a civil flag. The black–gold flag was used in a way similar to a modern national flag by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy within the Holy Roman Empire, by the later Austrian Empire, and by the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary, and was sometimes informally used for the entire empire, up until 1918.",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/a/ah-1.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_monarchy#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg,Historical,1828,2,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Black, Yellow",Equal Distribution,"Black, Yellow",Black,(There is no middle band),Yellow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_monarchy,u/Geogrartist,"Austria, Hungary"
2/27/2025 14:49:52,[ITA] Ladins,"The flag of Ladins is horizontal tricolour of blue, white, and green. The Ladin people are an ethnic group[1][2] in northern Italy. In 2024, the Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol recognized the flag, allowing it to be officially displayed in municipalities next to the Italian tricolour.[3]

The flag symbolizes the landscape: blue for the sky, white for the mountains and green for the meadows. The flag was introduced in 1920 during the Ladin Congress.[4] It is unclear whether the flag was allowed during the time of Italian fascism. There are some which have also symbols or even coats of arms of Ladin families or municipalities, but these are only created by irrelevant people or organizations, no official institutions. Examples for symbols based on the flag are the coat of arms of Canazei or the logo of the Ladin Autonomist Union.

2/27/2025 14:44:08,[SOM] Puntland,"On Tuesday, 22 December 2009, the Puntland Parliament adopted a new flag as the state's symbol. With more than 33 votes in favour, the Puntland Parliament has
showed that the state is ready to strengthen its political dimension as part of the Somali federation.

It is the first time the self declared state has adopted distinctive state symbols, since it's creation in 1998.

The Puntland constitution states that the regional administration should have it's own flag and anthem, as part of the Federal Republic of Somalia.  The flag and anthem of the state was selected by a commission of state officials and Puntland intellectuals.

The minister of Constitution and Federal Affairs of Puntland, Dr.Jima'ale, who chaired the commission presented the selected flag and state anthem to the parliament. Members of Parliament rejected the proposed anthem, but approved the flag and the state emblem.

The new flag consists of the three horizontal stripes in blue, white and green:

The blue stripe with the white star symbolize the Somali flag; of which Puntland is part.
The central white stripe symbolizes the peace and stability of the region.
The green stripe symbolizes the natural wealth of the Puntland State.
Jens Pattke, 23 Dec 2009

I'd just wanted you to know that as of 22 December 2009 the Puntland adopted a new flag and emblem to represent the State. This is along with the Somali Flag, which has not been replaced by the new flag but should fly beside the new Puntland flag as Puntland considers itself as part of Somalia and wants to join a future federal republic of Somalia.
Yasin Mursal, 11 Feb 2010

I have been able to obtain an English translation of the Puntland Constitution, as adopted 18 April 2012.  It was supplied by the Puntland Development Research Center.  It contains a description and explanation of colours and emblems of the flag and the coat of arms, as adopted 23 December 2009.

""Constitution of the Puntland State of Somalia
Title I – Founding Principles of Puntland
    Chapter One – Founding Principles
    Article 11: Flag, Emblem and Anthem of Puntland State

1. The flag of Puntland State shall be rectangular in shape and composed of three colours:
a) The top third portion of the rectangle shall be blue with a five-point white star in its centre, representing the Somali national flag.

This choice was based on the use of these colours by the National Committee for a Free Germany, a German anti-Nazi organisation that operated in the Soviet Union in the last two years of the war. In 1949, following a suggestion from Friedrich Ebert Jr., the black-red-gold tricolour was instead selected as the flag of the German Democratic Republic upon the formation of this state on 7 October 1949. From 1949 to 1959, the flags of both West and East Germany were identical. On 1 October 1959, the East German government changed its flag with the addition of coat of arms. In West Germany, these changes were seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the two Germanies.

Variant
The difference of the variant (right image above) is, that the seals here are grey, which either is their natural colour or a realization of silver. The anchor is brown, also its natural colour if made from wood.
Meaning:
The seals are canting, because ""wolves"" (lobos) is just an abbreviation of ""sea wolves"" (lobos marinhos), a species of seals. The anchor might symbolize harbour and fishery.

Coat of arms
The municipality coat-of-arms is a blue shield, golden anchor between two “sea wolves” of natural colour facing each other. Silver mural crown with five visible towers (city rank). White scroll with black lettering ""CÂMARA DE LOBOS"". The seal in conformity with the law with the lettering ""Câmara Municipal de Câmara de Lobos"".
translated by Sérgio Horta, 27 Nov 1999, from the Municipal website

""Câmara de Lobos"" means ""Wolves’ Chamber"" (here ""chamber"" meaning ""inlet"", ""harbour"" or ""bay""), the beasts on the coat of arms are seals, and those are canting arms. That is because in Madeira the local seal species (Monachus monachus, the Mediterranean Monk Seal) is called Lobo-marinho, meaning sea wolf (portuguese mainland biologists usually say Foca-monge do Mediterrâneo, but this is fading away).
António Martins, 26 Nov 1999

In English heraldry, a sea-wolf would be a mythological animal — Fox-Davies would actually call it a “monster”, not without reason — half wolf, half fish. That supposing there is any instance of a “sea-wolf” recorded at the College of Arms. The English blazon of Câmara de Lobos would hence mention «seals» and the arms would no longer be understood as canting, except of course an appropriate reference to the Portuguese terms be made.
Santiago Dotor, 29 Nov 1999

In A Glossary of Heraldry [prk70], Parker wrote:

Seal: It seems to have been fancifully called by some heraldic writers the sea-calf and sea-wolf. The whole animal, however, does not appear to be represented; only the paws and head, and then but rarely.

2/25/2025 16:27:29,[POR] Funchal,"Shield Vert five sugar loaves Or spirally garnished and coasted Purpure set in cross, the whole cornered by four grape bunches Or, each bearing an inescutcheon charged with five plates (“quina”) set in saltire. Mural crown Argent with five visible towers (city rank). White scroll below the shield with upper case black capitals 1) ""CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"" (left flag image above), or 2) with honorific scroll meaning «The noble and loyal city of Funchal»).
The cumbersome long text seems to have been set upon the scroll in two ways: In one line of text, set in a compact, slender face, as shown at this photo with inscription ""A NOBRE E LEAL CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"" (central flag image above) or within source, p.72 with inscription ""A NOBRE E LEAL"" in a much smaller fontsize, centred above the official 1936 text ""CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"" (lower, bigger line) (right flag image above), perhaps a token of ""defaced"" imagery, not newly produced, at least at first, shown here, and in many other sources.
The latter is quite representative of Portuguese municipal and submunicipal flags, it’s only uniqueness is the two lines of text in the scroll.

The five elements shown in the municipal coat of arms of Funchal (Madeira) are not beehives but rather sugar loaves, i.e., bread loaf shaped lumps of freshly cristallised sugar (conical mounds about 45 cm high and 30 cm at base), reminding of traditional sugar industry, which had in Funchal its first post-classical production unit in Christian hands (during the Middle Ages sugar came from India to Europe brought by Arab and Central Asian merchants). (In Rio de Janeiro the famous Pão de Açúcar mound has the same name.)

The flag of Funchal is exactly as shown, but not really frequent in the city.
Ivan Sache, 18 Feb 2001

The atypical scroll set in two lines, which is locally used, according to many sources (incl. my eyes, in my visits there in June 1995), is not prescribed by law (publ. Diário do Governo, I Série on March 24th, 1936), and the grapes are usually shown purple (Proper), not golden as the law prescribes.
António Martins-Tuválkin, 18 July 2004

In 2012 the scroll displayed simply ""CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"". This variant (left flag image) - and only this - was spotted in February 2012 in various places of the city, e.g. near the cathedral, on Autonomy Square, in front of the theatre, in front of the court, and in front of the local branch of Banco de Portugal.
Klaus-Michael Schneider, 8 Mar 2012

Still according to source, the flag was first hoisted at the City Hall on 28 May 1936, for the 10th anniversary of the so-called National Revolution: Indeed back then in 1936, freshly at the start of the dictatorial 2nd Portuguese Republic - the so-called New State (Estado Novo) - the text of the scroll was decided by the SHAAP (also freshly new itself) to be of the plain usual type, and not ""A NOBRE E LEAL CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"" (""the noble and loyal city of Funchal (=Fennelfield)""), the honorific, that had been used in the arms of the city since at least 1757 (and possibly much earlier), notably on the flag 1919 - 1936 that the new law was replacing. In all known previous Funchal arms either there is no scroll, or it reads simply ""Funchal"", or this honorific title is used (with varying spellings); its use is also attested in other emblematic media (source gives an interesting and exhaustive overview), and was very much alive at the time of the adoption of the new arms and flag.
This refusal to include the honorific is interesting, as the SHAAP was fully aware of its presence in the history of the Funchal arms, having been supplied with documentation by the municipal government - indeed the Dec.1935 final assessment was the last step of a five-year long process, in parallel with all other local government bodies that reacted to the CHAAP's ""call to arms"" of April 1930. It was an exceptional measure, as some of the arms newly created or ""confirmed"" by the SHAAP around this time do include similar special scroll texts - notably, also in 1936, the extra-unusual double scroll arms of Campo Maior: Whatever the reason, it was not a refusal against exceptional scrolls, it was a refusal against Funchal. Within source pp.46-48, it is hypothesised that the national government might have vetoed any kind of deferring treatment of Madeira, due to the local political sentiment against the regime at the time, causing the traditional honorific to be dropped in this case while upheld elsewhere.
In 1986, already in a democratic regime and after Madeira had become an Autonomous Region, the municipal government of Funchal decided to change concordantly the text of the scroll to include the full title ""A NOBRE E LEAL CIDADE DO FUNCHAL"" - this was decided in meeting of the municipal government on 31 July 1986 and approved by the municipal parliament on 3 October 1986 - the text of the decision deplores the ""colonialist stance"" of the 1936 law and seeks to mend that ""retaliatory and debasing act against this population"". This decision was never revoked, but the legal frame of the Portuguese legislation about local symbols (both the 1991 law and the 1930 dispatch it replaced) gives no authority to local government bodies to overrule CHAAP's decisions. In practice, the flag was locally changed by its own flag-bearing entity, though, and flags showing the honorific scroll are vexillological facts.
It should be noted that this 1986 kerfuffle did not change anything else in the 1936 law, nor the flag background (which was never an issue of contention, as the predecessors to the gyronny, _q.v._, were even less distinct and devoided of local significance), nor the presence of the additional grapes-&-quina - a novelty introduced in 1936 that was as ""retaliatory and debasing"" as the dropped honorific was. In my opinion that was due to the fact that said 1986 protestations were fueled by way more generic fires than mere heraldic purity - anybody can read honour in a honorific title, but few are sensitive to armorial simplicity as a token of heraldic dignity. (The recent case of Angra do Heroísmo, as well as the never resolved cases of São João da Madeira (no relation), Horta, and Caldas da Rainha, comes to mind.)
António Martins-Tuválkin, 21 Apr 2016

The legal prescription of this flag is yellow and purple gyronny, usually worded in Portuguese as ""gironado de amarelo e púrpura"", although it was officially described in the official law text, transcribed from the SHAAP's assessment of 1936 (fac-simile of the hand written original on p.103 of book Abreu & Gaspar, as ""quarteada de quatro peças de amarelo e quatro de púúrpura"" - litterally ""quartered of four yellow parts and four purple parts"", which litterally doesn't add up; a few years later SHAAP/CHAAP's wording had become more accurate, although some heraldic bad practices got stuck since the begining till today.
This prescription is usually realized as illustrated, with the firstly named ""tincture"", usually the metal, taking up the upper hoist corner of the sheet (i.e., and the three other alternated to it, and the secondly named ""tincture"", usually the colour, taking the remaining four rectangular triangles (editorial remark: the gyrons). Such is the arrangement found in the most original sources, such as photos of the official flags of 1936 and 1986 (_q.v._), kept in the City Hall, or the always accurate imagery by Sérgio Horta

Steve Shumaker, 18 September 2008

The blue Gaelic community flag is widely flown in Cape Breton Island by Gaels, and appears on all sorts of novelties in the gift shop at the Gaelic College, St. Anns. I saw one green flag in the form of a licence plate on the front of a car. I also noticed a locally produced 2012 calendar of Gaelic language and culture that explains the meaning of the design on the flags.

The Gaelic symbol is a salmon in the shape of the letter G. The salmon is for the gift of knowledge in the Gaelic traditions of Nova Scotia, Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. The G is for the Gaelic language. The ripples are for the manifestations of the language through song, story, music, dance, and custom and belief system.

That salmon is important to the Gaels goes way back to the legend of Fionn McCool and the Salmon of Knowledge. Ad a young man, Fionn was sent to study under the wise man Finegas who lived by the river. Now Finegas had been watching for the Salmon of Knowledge for seven years, but after Fionn joined him as a disciple, the salmon was soon caught. Finegas gave it to Fionn to cook, warning him to eat none of it. As Fionn turned the fish on the fire, he burned his thumb and quickly put his thumb in his mouth to soothe the pain. When Finegas saw Fionn coming with the cooked fish, he knew that something had happened, for Fionn had a special look about him. Finegas questioned him and learned about the burned thumb. He realized that it was Fionn who was destined to eat of the Salmon of Knowledge, not himself. Then he said to the lad who stood by obideiently, �Take the salmon and eat it, Fionn, son of Cumhal, for to you the prophecy is come.� Fionn ate the salmon and became the wisest and bravest of men, with the gift of seeing into the past and into the future.

The winds must not be associated with a tropical cyclone.[1] If the winds are associated with a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning will be substituted for the storm warning and less severe gale warning.

In US maritime warning flag systems, a red square flag with a black square taking up the middle ninth of the flag is used to indicate a storm warning (the use of two such flags denotes a hurricane force wind warning or a hurricane warning). The same flag as a storm warning is used to indicate a tropical storm warning.

On land, the National Weather Service issues a 'high wind warning' (Specific Area Message Encoding code: HWW) for storm-force winds, which also encompasses the lesser gale-force and greater hurricane force winds. In most cases, the warning applies to winds of 40-114 MPH for at least 1 hour; or any gusts of 58-114 miles per hour on land unless a tropical storm warning, blizzard warning, winter storm warning, severe thunderstorm warning, or dust storm warning covers the phenomenon. Winds in excess of 115 MPH (100 kt) will always result in new issuance of an extreme wind warning shortly before their onset, typically right before the eyewall of a major hurricane makes landfall, but possibly as a substitute for a severe thunderstorm warning in an extreme derecho event. The only exception is that if the extreme winds are associated with a tornado, a tornado warning (or more likely a tornado emergency) will be issued instead.",https://www.fotw.info/images/u/us_whurr.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_warning#/media/File:Weather_Warning_Flag_(United_States).svg,Warning ,???,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Red",Red,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_warning,u/Geogrartist,Additional Flags

On 29 November 1994, the Jujuy Province adopted this design as its flag. The original flag is 1.40 m high and 0.90 m wide, white in color, and has the coat of arms of the Assembly of the Year XIII in the center.

Provincial Law No. 4816 of 29 November 1994 established the first flag of Jujuy. The law stated that the provincial flag would be a white field with the coat of arms identical to the flag of the Civil Freedom of Argentina, but did not define the proportions. On May 30, 2013, the previous Act was repealed and replaced by Act No. 5772.

2/18/2025 2:39:55,[LSO] Lesotho (1987 - 2006),"Following a military coup which deposed the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) government which had led the country since independence, a new flag was adopted on 17 January 1987. It is believed that the old flag was scrapped because it was identified too closely with the BNP and incorporated its colours of red, white, blue and green.

The flag was adopted on January 20, 1987 after a military coup in which the military replaced the governing Basotho National Party. That's why the shield and spears are included - they signify the importance of defence.
Steve Kramer and Bruce Berry, 02 May 1996

In an article about the then new Lesotho flag in The Flag Bulletin (XXVI:4 = 121 of 1987: p. 175) [tfb87a] Fred Brownell, then State Herald of South Africa, and who is fluent in Sesotho and as such was able to directly participate in the 1987 discussions leading to the design of the new Lesotho flag, in which he was involved in an official capacity.
António Martins-Tuválkin, 04 June 2008

According to the Lesotho Government Gazette Extraordinary of 15 January 1987, the new national flag is a rectangular tricolor in proportion three by two, per bend reversed, white, blue and green, the white occupying half the surface area of the flag and charged, with the centre line one fifth of the distance from the hoist with an assegai and knobkerrie in saltire, surmounted of a traditional Basotho shield with plumed spine, all in light brown; the blue and green each occupying half the remaining surface area of the flag.

The colours of the new flag represent the three elements of the national motto: white for peace; blue for rain and green for prosperity. It is for this reason that the blue and green stripes are not separated even though when viewed from a distance they merge together.
Steve Kramer and Bruce Berry, 02 May 1996

National Flag. CSW/--- 2:3
Tricolour of white blue green divided in rising diagonal and with light brown emblem in canton.
The flag is divided along diagonal in upper white part, while the lower fly triangle is divided in blue and green parallel to the diagonal dividing it in two equal areas. With the  flag overall ratio 2:3, this would mean that the blue stripe width would be 1/4 of the hoist size. (at least as I figured it out, I would appreciate if some would check that out, and possibly provide decent
mathematical explanation).
The emblem size is not quite defined, but the vertical axis is to be along line 1/5 of the flag length from the hoist.

The Lesotho Flag is based on the traditional motto of the Lesotho Nation: Khotso  (Peace); Pula (Rain); Nala (Prosperity); It was promulgated through the National Flag Order No. 1 of 1987, and hoisted for the first time on January 20, 1987.

White occupies the top triangular half with diagonal traversing from left bottom corner adjoining the hoist. Blue and green: each occupy half the surface area of the lower triangle, in that order. The light brown shield is situated on the white half of the flag, with its centre line one fifth (1/5) of the distance from the hoist. Supported by an assegai (left), a bludgeon (right), and a plumed spine (centre), it symbolises the Lesotho Nation's traditional safeguards for peace.""

Santiago Dotor, 24 Feb 2000

Your various correspondents are a little unclear on the shields appearing in the arms and current flag of Lesotho. Both are examples of a style which varies quite a bit. One can gain a sense of the variations when one compares these Lesotho shields with those in the arms of Bophuthatswana and Qwaqwa. (Bophuthatswana is in Armoria, but Qwaqwa not yet. You'll find both in International Civic Arms).  The shape of the Tswana shield is distinct from the South Sotho variety, yet the Tswana and Sotho shields have characteristics that set them apart from the Nguni shield which is more common in Southern Africa.

In the Tswana shield (and the one used by Qwaqwa, a South Sotho state) the four corners stick out more or less straight, and have their ends cut off straight. In the Sotho version they hang down slightly (more so on the Lesotho flag) and are rounded. Yet both varieties are characterised by what one might called a nipped waist.  Individual shield makers in different villages no doubt work to a common concept, but incorporate local variations. After all, these shields are (like the Nguni shield type) made of hide and mounted on a frame of sticks, so their outline depends very much on who is cutting the hide.

Another characteristic that the Sotho and Tswana shields have in common is that they are normally made fairly small, maximum height 30cm, for use in stick-fighting - which is the traditional recreation of young men among both the Basotho and the abeNguni.

This is in contrast with the Nguni shield, which although nowadays chiefly also used in stick-fighting mode, is still to be seen in larger formats recalling their use in actual warfare. Various Nguni dance troops (chiefly Zulu) use these shields, most often in the style introduced by the Zulu King Shaka.  In reforming the style of warfare in his realm (in the process building a kingdom out of his own rather small Zulu clan and the Mthethwa confederacy, whose king had taken him under his wing), Shaka abolished the traditional large Nguni shield, which stood about the height of a man.  The warrior traditionally stood behind his shield while the enemy threw long throwing spears, and then stepped out to throw his own spears - or return the enemy's. This practice of hiding behind the shield gave rise to the Sotho (especially North Sotho) name for the Nguni peoples: Matabele.

This means ""people who hide behind large shields"". The word was taken into isiNguni as Ndebele, and came to be used for three distinct Nguni groups: the amaNdebele (or South Ndebele) of Mpumalanga, the amaNdebele (North Ndebele) of Limpopo Province, and the amaNdebele of Zimbabwe. The North and South Ndebele have lived in the Transvaal region for at least three centuries, whereas the Zimbabwean tribe (created by their king Mzilikazi, previously one of Shaka's lieutenants) are a product of the Mfecane (the period of widespread tribal warfare sparked off by Shaka).  Shaka reduced the length of the spear to only 90cm, and decreed that it should be used for stabbing. (This weapon is properly called the assegai; other spears are not assegais.) To go with the assegai, the shield was reduced to about 60cm in height, and was reduced to being used to ward off blows in hand-to-hand fighting.

In case you're not clear on the shape of the Nguni shield, it appears in the arms of Ciskei, KwaZulu, Gauteng, Swaziland and Gazankulu. Elsewhere it can be seen in the arms of Kenya and Tanzania, while it appears in error in the arms of Botswana.  Swaziland shows a variation in the Nguni shield shape: it is quite a bit fatter than the other examples. Also, in these arms, the Nguni shield is a charge on a shield of Western shape.

I saw some interesting information about the Tswana definition of ""thebe"" in your web page about Lesotho. Thebe in Setswana means a ""shield"".  I did check the cited reference on this definition but I think it is a mistake.

2/15/2025 1:54:02,[USA] Blue Star Service Banner,"The ""Sons in Service"" flag was used during World War I and World War II. Each family was entitled to hang a small Son In Service flag in their window, the blue star in the center of the red-bordered white rectangle signified a family member in active service. The star was replaced (or covered) with a gold star (in practice, yellow or dark yellow) if the family member died in action. (Hence the name of the organization ""Gold Star Mothers"" of women who had lost sons in the war.) There were other variations to the star for missing in action, injured, captured, etc, etc, but flags of that sort are rarely, if ever, seen.

Sons in Service flags made and used by families usually were no larger than about one foot long. They were always hung vertically, a stick being sewn into the top heading of the flag and a piece of string attached to both ends of the stick - the string suspended at its midpoint from a hook or some other feature of a front window of the home.

If a family had a husband and a son, or multiple family members in the service of their country, then additional blue stars were set into the white rectangle. Organizations and corporations extended this practice to fly flags incorporating stars for each of their members/employees who were off to war and, of course, would change/overlay the blue stars with gold ones when the news came back that one of theirs had died in action. These larger flags (I have one with some 50 stars in a circle, a quarter of them in gold, measuring about 8 feet long overall) were sometimes flown outside on a pole, but most often were suspended from the ceiling of the factory / meeting hall indoors.

It is not always easy to determine a date for these flags, though I believe that WW I era flags were more likely to be made of wool, and WW II flags usually were sewn of cotton bunting. However, they are definitely no older than 1917, the date of entry of the USA into WW I. Some WW II era flags with one or two stars were printed on silk and sold retail for those who didn't feel like sewing their own.
Nick Artimovich, 2 May 1997

To elaborate on what Nick Artimovich and Nathan Bliss wrote about this flag, I have a book entitled ""The Flag of the United States -- Your Flag and Mine"" by Harrison S. Kerrick (Champlin Printing Co., Columbus, Ohio; 1925) that states (pg. 114):

""The State of Massachusetts, by resolution of its House of Representatives, May 28, 1918, established a new form of recognition of service under the U.S. Flag, based upon the practice that arose during the World War of displaying in the home office, club, or factory, a blue star (loyalty, sincerity, justice) upon a white field (hope, purity, truth) each star representing a member of the family or organization in service, by adding thereto certain emblems symbolizing events of service as indicated on opposite page.""
The illustration shows nine different emblems, all based on the blue 5-pointed star (pointing up). It is entitled ""The Star of Service - For the Flag, for Liberty, for Justice."":
A Blue Star - ""Service in Army or Navy.""
A Blue Star with a Gold Greek Cross in the Center - ""Wounded in Service.""
A Blue Star with a Gold Ring superimposed - ""Decorated for Distinguished Service.""
An inverted Blue Star with both the Gold Greek Cross and the Gold Ring (as in (2) and (3)) - ""Missing.""
An inverted Blue Star inside of a Red Ring - ""Captured.""
An inverted Blue Star superimposed over a Red Pentagon - ""Wounded and Decorated for Distinguished Service.""
A Gold Star bordered Blue with a Gold Ring superimposed on it - ""Decorated for Distinguished Service,"" also seems to indicate the serviceman died, but that is not stated.
A Blue Star superimposed over a Red Pentagon with a Gold Greek Cross in the Center and a Gold Ring Superimposed on it - ""Wounded, Decorated for Distinguished Service and Missing.""
A Gold Star bordered Blue with a Laurel Wreath superimposed on it - ""Died in Service. Laurel Wreath Optional.""
Below the illustrations is the following caption:
""Gold represents wounds, distinguished service and death. Red, represents missing or captured. If desired, rank may be shown by the proper insignia of Officer or non-Commissioned Officer placed directly above the star. Service in the 'Zone of Advance' and foreign service may be symbolized by a gold chevron placed below the star, one shown for each six months of such service.""
Notice there is no mention of the red border of the flag, as used in practice.
Dave Martucci, 2 May 1997

This appears to be a service star flag for ""Service in the 'Zone of Advance' and foreign service may be symbolized by a gold chevron placed below the star, one shown for each six months of such service.""
Randy Cowart, 11 April 2006

I have just stumbled across a site which seems to indicate a couple more symbols being used - red crosses for nurses and chaplains crosses for chaplains. Whether this usage was official or unofficial I know not.

From a Texas church history page-
""Pastor Bloom served the church during World War 1, and also acted as chaplain of the Eight Infantry Regiment of the Texas National Guard. The church's service flag has forty-six blue stars representing those in the various military branches, plus two red crosses for nurses and Chaplain's cross for Pastor Bloom. Three of the blue stars were replaced by gold ones for the three sons of the church who died in the war.""

""Juneteenth is the holiday that celebrates the day that all the slaves in America became free. I created the final design for the Juneteeth Flag. People who contributed to the process were Boston Ben, Verlene Hines, Azim, and Eliot Design.

The Juneteenth flags represent the history, and freedom the American Slaves and their descendants. The design of the Juneteenth flag depicts a bursting ""new star"", on the horizon.

2/15/2025 1:37:15,[SCO] Royal Banner of Scotland,"The Royal Arms of Scotland are ""or, a lion rampant gules, armed and langued azure, within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second"". Many flag makers omit the blue on the tongue and claws simply because they are printing the flags (Rampant Lion flags in Scotland tend to be the cheap handwaving type, except for the few official ones) and don't want to bother with another pass for the blue.
Graham Bartram, 20 July 1999
The old Scottish flag is still valid. Strictly speaking, it should only be used by Her Majesty the Queen in her capacity as Queen of Scots. In actuality, it tends to be used as a second national flag.
Stuart Notholt

It is true that this flag should only be used by the King of Scots (or the Queen of Scots). That means no one should use it, as there has not been a Kingdom of Scotland since 1707 (just as there has been no Kingdom of England since 1707, when the two kingdoms became one United Kingdom of Great Britain). The heir apparent, the Duke of Rothesay (a.k.a. the Prince of Wales), is entitled to bear this Scottish coat (differenced by a label azure) as an escutcheon on his Scottish arms and banner, as registered in Lyon Register. Yes, it tends to be used as a second national flag, even though technically illegal. I seem to recall, possibly from Sir Thomas Innes of Learney's Scots Heraldry, that King George V leant heavily on the then Lord Lyon King of Arms to prevent him prosecuting the manufacturers and retailers of such flags. If true, such a move by the king was not only unhistorical and unconstitutional, but definitely illegal and contrary to the Bill of Rights of 1689 which forbids the Crown to interfere in the actions of the judiciary.
Simon Kershaw

This is debatable. The Queen is still Queen of Scots even if there isn't a 'Kingdom of Scotland' - Scottish constitutional law used to make a distinction between the two. You're right about the technical illegality of private citizens using the flag - although I wouldn't want to debate the point too closely with, say, 30,000 Lion Rampart bearing Scots soccer fans.
Stuart Notholt

I don't agree with Stuart Notholt about the Queen's title. In law she is Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (by an Act passed in the reign of William III, as modified by the Act of Union with Ireland, 1800 and the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which re-defined Ireland to mean Northern Ireland). There is no such person as the Queen of Scots, or Queen of England (as Americans are often surprised to learn). On the other hand I don't agree with Simon Kershaw entirely either. The Act of Union of 1707 did not strictly speaking extinguish Scotland as a separate kingdom, but gave control over Scotland to the Westminster Parliament. It extinguished the separate Scottish legislature, which is why many Scots nationalists are campaigning to get it back. The Act referred to above had already determined that Scotland and England should have the same monarch. In practice there is a royal flag (the Red Lion) and royal arms for Scotland, used for Scottish government purposes. The Red Lion flag flies over Dover House in London and New St Andrew's House in Edinburgh. Nor can we say that King George interfered with the judiciary, because it is common practice for the monarch to establish flags and arms by Royal Warrant (e.g. the modern flag of Canada). The incident referred to was a Royal Warrant signed by George V on 3 September 1934 allowing the use of the Red Lion as 'a mark of loyalty,' (because of the forthcoming Jubilee celebrations). The Lord Lyon officially now takes the view that this permission 'related to decorative ebullition,' i.e. being waved or draped at football matches. He is however very down on flying the Red Lion as a flag, and once threatened the town councilors of Cumbernauld with an Act passed in 1679 which prescribed the death penalty for misuse of the royal arms.

Lyon is an officer of the King of Scots' household. If he can not tell his own retinue what do to, who can he tell anything?
Will Linden
No, he is not. Lyon is a high judicial officer, with his own court of law. It is in his judicial capacity that Lyon prosecutes offenders against the heraldic law in Scotland.
Simon Kershaw

Taken from rec.heraldry:

I think this is recorded in Innes of Learney's Scots Heraldry, p.215, footnote 2: ""By Royal Warrant, 3 September 1934, permission is granted for H.M.'s loyal subjects to display the flag as a mark of loyalty to the Sovereign. This is, in legal technique, decorative ebullition and does not cover other uses. (Cf. Nisbet, Heraldry, ii, iii, 69). The warrant actually contravened the Declaration of Rights, 1695."" In the text on the same page, he says: ""When the Royal Lion is flown as a flag, or in place of the Scottish National Flag, St Andrew's Cross, a statutory offence is committed against the ordinary Parliamentary Law of Scotland (1672, cap. 47; Acts, viii, 95) as well as a piece of heraldic bad taste. [...] Usurpation of the Royal Arms or Banner still legally renders the offender liable to the capital penalty, and momentous consequences can still arise out of irregular display of the Royal Flag.""
Pascal Vagnat, 1996-9-5

The Flag Bulletin, no. 155, November-December 1993, states:

""... on 3 September 1934 King George V issued a royal warrant to Lord Lyon Sir Francis James Grant forbidding Lyon Court to interfere with any use of the Lion Flag 'as a mark of loyalty to the Sovereign.' Lyon Court has interpreted this as meaning that hand-held flags are permissible but not those on poles, although this was not spelled out in the royal warrant.""
Strictly speaking, the Royal Warrant doesn't legalize use of the Lion Flag, merely urges that no action be taken against those who use it. The view that anyone flying the flag does so out of loyalty to the sovereign is of course simply a convenient way of legitimizing its use - as I mentioned before I doubt many of those who use the flag do so out of fidelity to the Queen. However, unless the reports of the 1934 warrant are inaccurate (which seems unlikely) it does appear that the de facto use of the Lion Flag by private citizens is tolerated.
Stuart Notholt, 6 September 1996
A rather surprising change has been announced recently. It concerns the Scottish palace of Holyrood House in Edinburgh. From now on this will fly the ancient Scottish royal standard (red lion rampant on gold in a double tressure) unless the Queen is in residence, in which case it will fly the current Royal Standard, which for some reason doesn't change north of the border, although the arms on which it is based do.
Graham Bartram, 9 March 1998

The Baronage Press has a recent edition of the magazine with a page dedicated to the late Queen Mother. From here one can navigate back to a two-part series on the Lyon family - which would appear to be a branch of the Bruce family, and which in turn seems to originate (and derive its name) from Bruggen (Bruges) in Flanders. At the end of the second article on the Lyons and Bruces, there is brief mention of the arms of the Earls of Fife, or, a lion rampant gules, and of a differenced version of those arms by the Abernethy family. To my mind the most interesting point here is Sir Iain Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe's speculation that the royal tressure was added by the Scottish kings as a mark of difference from the Earls of Fife, since the Fifes were the senior branch of the family. You will note, when you look at the Queen Mother's ""standard"" (more properly, banner), that in the upper middle part of the flag, two rampant lions within royal tressures stand side by side. It's been known for generations that the royal tressure is a mark of royalty - in the case of the Lyon family, it recalls the marriage between Sir John Lyon of Glamis and the Lady Jean, daughter of King Robert II. But it's interesting to reflect that the royal tressure in both these quarters also indicates a difference from a senior branch.
Mike Oettle, 23 April 2002

The ""Court of the Lord Lyon Information Leaflet No. 3"" sets out the rules for flag display in Scotland. Lord Lyon is the legal heraldic authority for Scotland. Apart from providing a (sometimes difficult to understand) discussion of the different kinds of heraldic flags used in Scotland (banners, standards, pipe banners, guidons pennons, and pinsels), how big they should be for what users and uses, and so on, the leaflet says regarding the red lion rampant flag:

""12. This is NOT a national flag and its use by citizens and corporate bodies is entirely wrong. Gold, with a red rampant lion and royal tressure. It is the Scottish Royal banner, and its correct use is restricted to only a few Great Officers who officially represent the Sovereign, including the Secretary of State for Scotland as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, Lord Lieutenants in their Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and other lieutenants specially appointed. Its use by other, non-authorised persons is an offence under the Acts 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17.""

and, if that's not clear enough,

""22. The personal banner of the King of Scots may NOT be flown by anyone other than those specifically authorised as variously representing the Sovereign, as set out in para. 12 above. Its use by other non-authorised persons is an offence under the Acts 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17. The freedom of use accorded to the Saltire Flag is NOT extended to the Scottish Royal Banner.""

Interesting that Lyon doesn't bother to mention that inconvenient royal order from 1934 forbidding Lyon from interfering with public display of the red lion flag as an expression of loyalty to the Sovereign, as discussed above.
Joe McMillan, 4 February 2003

William, who succeeded his father, Malcolm IV in 1165, was known as William the Lion, but there is no positive evidence that the lion rampant had become ""the Arms of Dominion of Scotland"" before 1222, when it appeared in the seal of his son, Alexander II.
David Prothero, 3 November 2000

The earliest reference I can find to the lion coat of arms is the great seal of King Alexander II, dating from 1222. The surviving seals from this matrix are not in good condition, and it is possible that they not include the double tressure. The first seal that definitely contains the double tressure is from the reign of his son Alexander III (d.1286). The (English) Matthew Paris Roll of c.1244 depicts the arms of the Scottish king with a single tressure flory counter-flory - which may be fact or simply an artist's mistake.
Source: MacAndrew, Bruce, 'Scotland's historic heraldry' (Woodbridge, Boydell Press, 2006)
Ian Sumner, 21 February 2007

Fox-Davies in A Complete Guide to Heraldry confirms both statements and later quotes Chalmers' ""Caledonia"" saying, ""the lion may possibly have been derived from the arms of the old Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, from whom some of the Scottish kings were descended"". Fox-Davies also mentions a legendary explanation by Nisbet according to which, ""the lion has been carried on the armorial ensign of Scotland since the first founding of the monarchy by King Fergus I -- a very mythical personage (...) about 300 B.C."".
Santiago Dotor, 7 November 2000

William the Lion (1143-1214) is generally credited with adopting this symbol, although records of this are uncertain. It was referred to as the ""Lion of Justice"" and the ""Lion of Bravery"".
1222: first known use under Alexander II, on a seal. It also appears on a seal of Alexander III. The design was surprisingly complex for its time - possibly the double tressure fleury counter fleury is related to the French fleur de lys, although that is not known until 1223 in France. Before this time, the Scottish royal standard bore a dragon (known in 1138). Nisbet quotes the use of the lion rampant by Fergus I in 300 BC, although there is no extant evidence for this.
James VI quartered the arms of the United Kingdom after the Union of the Crowns (1605), using the lion rampant, the three English lions, fleur de lys and harp (see here). The lion rampant is much used in the arms of nobles in Scotland (e.g., Lord Lyon).
1998: Queen Elizabeth began to use a Scottish Royal standard in Scotland.
Graham Bartram, 26 July 2001

The double tressure flory counterflory was added as a difference from the arms of the Earl of Fife. The earldom is still held by the same family (the incumbent has for the past century or so been Duke of Fife as well), and they still bear or, a lion rampant gules. And The Baronage Press mentions that the double tressure (in shorthand, a royal tressure in its Scottish usage) was long established in use in Flanders, and so was ready to hand as a difference.
Mike Oettle, 28 February 2005

The Forman Roll, presented to Mary Queen of Scots in 1552, shows the use a lion rampant with Malcolm Canmore III in 1068.
Mary Sawant, 20 February 2007

All it really shows, I think, is that the compiler of the Forman Roll (in c.1565) thought that the arms of the King of Scotland were borne by Malcolm III Canmore, not that he actually did bear those arms (in the same way that other rolls of arms attribute arms to Julius Caesar and even Jesus Christ). Forman was the owner, if not the compiler, of several rolls of arms from the middle of the sixteenth century, possibly in his role as Lord Lyon King of Arms. This one is referred to as Forman's British Library Roll. It leaps from Malcom III (d.1093) to Robert I (d.1329) on the next page, concentrating on the Bruce and Stewart dynasties, and mentioning King John Baliol only to describe him as 'traytor', so it may not be an impartial piece of historical investigation.

2/15/2025 1:19:58,[IND] Kingdom of Sikkim (1962-1975),"At present there is no official flag of Sikkim, a state in India. The independent Kingdom of Sikkim did have a national flag until it became a state of India in 1975.
From Barraclough (1971):

""Sikkim, formerly a protectorate of India, was incorporated as the twenty-second state of the union in May 1975, and the office of the hereditary ruler, the Chogyal, was abolished. Sikkim has, or had, a flag of white with a red border all round, and a yellow Chakra (fimbriated in red) in the centre.""

""...the Chakra [is] a Buddhist symbol representing the Law of Dharma, or eternal change."" The Chakra on the flag of Sikkim is different then the one on India's flag. It has eight spokes rather than the many spokes on India's, and has an ornate ""nub"" on the wheel at the head of each spoke.
Don Hagemann, 28 November 1995
[editor's note: The source of this quote is not Barraclough (1971), but probably a later edition of the Carr-Barraclough-Crampton series]
In Flags of Aspirant Peoples the flag of Sikkim is similar to the one above with minor differences in the Chakra.
Ivan Sache, 16 Sep 1999

Sikkim was an antiquated Shangri-La anachronism with a fairly ineffectual Chogyal (Gyalsay Palden Thondup Namgyal) whose only claim to fame was marrying New York socialite Hope Cook. India was never comfortable with this weak link in its China defences. All the same, India's annexation of Sikkim (during the controversial emergency rule of Indira Gandhi) was widely regarded as unnecessarily heavy-handed. India pretty much forced a new constitution on Sikkim, which considerably reduced the Chogyal's powers (he had ruled as a feudal autocrat). There was also a referendum in Sikkim in favour of union with India, (although there is some uncertainty how free the poll was). This was ratified by the 38th amendment to the Indian Constitution (making Sikkim its 22nd state) on 26 April 1975. Unlike the Tibet issue which never dies, I don't think anybody seriously thinks of Sikkim independence.

2/14/2025 13:35:44,[IRE] Fingal County Council,"Dublin County Council was abolished on 1 January 1994 and replaced by three new county councils. One of these is Fingal County Council. The new council has adopted as its flag a vertical bicolour of dark green and white - colours which appear to have been taken from the council's arms and which, as far as I know, had no previous association with the area.

The arms are centred in the white stripe and show a Viking longboat and a raven (another Norse emblem and one which appeared on the arms and flag of the old Dublin County Council), both of which recall the Norse settlement of Fingal in the 9th and 10th centuries - the Irish form of the place name, Fine Gall, means ""foreign tribe"". The emblem in the upper left of the shield is a St Brigid's cross (a small cross woven from straw which is traditional in the area) and the sheaf of wheat in the upper right of the shield represents Fingal's position as one of the principal corn-growing areas in Ireland. The motto (Flúirse Talaimh is Mara) means ""abundance of land and of sea"" - Fingal contains a number of fishing ports.

2/14/2025 13:30:50,[IRE] Bray,"I have unearthed the following information on the flag of Bray Town Council (formerly Urban District Council), County Wicklow, Ireland.

Towards the end of 1955 the Bray Urban District Council decided to replace the seal with an official coat of arms. This, it was felt, would give the town ""a distinctive character and prestige"". At the meeting it was also stated that it was intended that it would be used for a municipal flag which would be flown on special civic occasions. The then Wicklow County Manager, Mr. M Flannery was closely involved in designing the arms. The design was agreed at a council meeting on February 14th 1956, and the following arms granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland on 1st June 1956:

Per chevron gules and azure, a chevron rompu or charged with a martlet sable, in the dexter chief a bell in the sinister a lion passant of the third, in base a mermaid with comb and mirror proper.

The broken or ""rompu"" chevron across the centre of the shield represents the bridge over the Dargle River. The chevron is charged with a black martlet. This is taken from the arms of the Brabazon family. The Brabazons, who became Earls of Meath, gained land at Bray on the dissolution of the Abbey of Saint Thomas and played a large part in the development of the town. The bell represents the ruined church of Raheenacluig on Bray Head. The lion is from the O'Toole arms. The family had a castle at Powerscourt, and were associated with the Bray area for centuries. The arms are completed by a mermaid from the O'Byrne arms. The O'Byrnes maintained Gaelic ways of life in Wicklow for many centuries, the area only being brought under English at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

The municipal flag, a banner of the arms, was officially unfurled at Bray Town Hall on 11th August 1956.

2/14/2025 13:03:41,[IRE] [GBR] Panceltic Flag,"The flag is a collage of the flags of the six Celtic nations (clockwise from upper left): Brittany, Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland. I don't know the exact name of the emblem at the centre, but there is, at the British Museum, a very ancient bronze enameled shield by La Tène culture, from early 1st century BC, which has three circles in vertical disposition, the middle one bigger than the others, which has similar wavy patterns forming intricate designs, though not the one seen at the flag. So, the symbol has to be very ancient too.

Blas Delgado Ortiz, 10 February 2002

Linguistically, the Celtic culture (barely) survived only in the peripheral areas of the British Isles and in the French Brittany. These are the areas to this day more Celtic in nature. But throughout the northwestern Iberia (Spanish Galicia and Asturias and the Portuguese Trás os Montes), Celtic roots survived intensely in traditions and folklore. This area is a sort of second 
league in the ranking of ""Celticness"", despite having a Latin language (four of them, actually: Galician, Portuguese, Asturo-Leonese and Castillan). The flag above would be a flag of the first league, those areas with not only Celtic culture, but also Celtic language.

Jorge Candeias, 11 February 2002

The symbol in the center is a Triskell (in Breton Gaelic). It's a very old solar symbol. The meaning is the cycles of the universe : the years, the seasons, Life and Death etc.... It's a very positive and powerful symbol in our traditions.

Xavier Moritz, 13 January 2005

The emblem at the centre of the Collage Celtic Flag is called the triskele. The insigne of the Isle of Man, three human legs radiating from a central point, is another form of the same motif. The spiral triskele shown on the flag is a very ancient Celtic design, and one of the most frequently found symbols at ancient sites inhabited by Celtic people. I have seen the abstract spiral triskele, such as the design at the centre of the flag, described as a sun symbol and a symbol of fertility and/or pregnancy. Though it predates Christianity in the Celtic countries, some Christians prefer to think of it as symbolising the Trinity. Like the triquetra or 'Trinity knot', a related ancient Celtic symbol, the triskele is sometimes considered to represent the",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/i/int-celt.gif,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/6_Celtic_nations_flag.png,Pan Celtic,???,6,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"Yes, and it is not a bird",dragon,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6,"Black, Yellow","Black, Blue, Green, Orange, Red, Yellow, White",White,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-celt.html#des,u/Geogrartist,"Ireland, United Kingdom"

ISO/QS Certification Flags
I just came across a flag, supposed to be a variant of the ISO. The flag, seen here. Source mentions ""(the) City's Wastewater Division Becomes State Forerunner with Environmental Management Certification - ISO 14001:2004 Certified"", talking about the government's Division of Tallahassee.
The flag most likely reads ""ISO 14001"" on top, and ""REGISTERED"" on the bottom, on blue capital letters on a white horizontal background, as seen in this other picture:
However on the first mentioned picture, one can see a logo on the bottom right, which I cannot identify.
Esteban Rivera, 15 June 2011

Rather than representing the ISO, this flag communicate the presence of an environmental management system conforming with ISO 14001, in particular one that has been registered with NSF International Strategic Registrations. A photo of the same design at another Tallahassee Water Utility wastewater facility (perhaps relating to an earlier registration) can be found in this document. (Tallahassee's Water Utility Wastewater Division 'Goes Green' with ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management Certification/, pp22-24, Florida Water Resources Journal, May 2008), revealing that the logo in the bottom hoist is that of NSF - a blue cirle with the white letters 'NSF'.
The flags were presented to the Water Utility along with the certification plaque, and are presumably generally provided by NSF when they registered a compliant system.
NSF is a non-government organisation, and while we see the flag hoisted by a (local) government utility, I'm sure the flag could equally be given to non-government entities.
(Of course, the ISO is itself not exactly a government organisation.)
Jonathan Dixon, 16 and 17 June 2011

If it's similar to the ones at this page, then it might be a globe.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 25 June 2011

On this picture one can see an array of flags behind de fire truck. From left to right, there's a white horizontal flag with an inscription that reads ""ISO 9001"" and below ""CERTIFIED"". I don't know if ISO issues a specific flag for the ISO 9001 certification and what would the rules for such flags would be.

This page depicts an â€œISO Flagâ€ â€“ in this case, a flag with the ISO logo on it. I wanted to point out that this flag would not be available for anyone to purchase and may only exist at the ISO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
Generally, if someone searches for an â€œISO Flagâ€ they are looking for a flag with which to publicize the fact that they are certified to any of various ISO standards.
What is slightly problematic about the image on this page is that the ISO expressly forbids the use of their logo by other entities. So the graphic on the page is an image of a unicorn, in a sense.
I would like to point out that the flags offered by USFlagDepot.com are not the most current, nor the most popular designs for ISO flags. In fact, or site, StandardFlags.com is considered the authority on ISO flags in that we have the widest selection of ISO flags, many for certifications that cannot be found any place else, and further, we are the copyright holders of the designs seen and sold on our site.
For reference: https://standardflags.com/
Weâ€™ve spent a great deal of time creating these designs such that they are unique to the eye and are representative of the standard which they represent.
We wondered how we might get a link on your page?
Also, if you would like more extensive coverage on this topic, I would be glad to write content for you which explains the designs and symbolism for each type of flag. There are about 11 certifications for which we currently have flag designs.
Our designs are licensed to JC Schultz who is our exclusive producer.
Chris Mitchell, Owner, StandardFlags.com, 27 January 2015

As I read it, he's advertising their version of the banners, and the only vexillological information, which he did not even write out, is that those flags are not an ISO matter, but could be any design, produced by anyone. Apparently nothing stops me from walking around with a flag with the text ""This Flag is ISO certified.""
As we're non-commercial, I guess you could thank him for that bit of information and leave it at that.

It has considerable mineral resources, but a disastrous leak of mine tailings in 1996 forced the closure of the copper mines. Its chief products are coconuts, rice, maize, fruits, vegetables, livestock, fish, wood, and the products of a number of small-scale industries. Off the coast are three small islands called the Three Kings, individually Gaspar, Melchor, and Baltazar, a favoured spot for day-trips and diving; a Spanish galleon was found off Gaspar in forty meters of water in 1981.

The figure of Hope formed the crest, and the shield was supported by a wildebeest and a gemsbok. The motto 'Spes Bona' ('Good Hope') was displayed below the shield.
The symbolism of the arms is straightforward. The lion is a South African animal, and also appears in the arms of the two colonial powers which ruled at the Cape, Netherlands and Great Britain. The rings were taken from the arms of the founder of the colony, Jan van Riebeeck. The fleur-de-lis represent the contribution of the Huguenots to the early history of the country. The crest is the Lady of Good Hope, grasping an anchor, first introduced as a symbol of the colony in 1715.[3] The supporters, a gnu (wildebeest) and an oryx (gemsbok), are two typical South African animals.

Its color is borrowed from the older and well-established symbol of breast cancer awareness, the pink ribbon [1]. Most frequently, the flag using this symbol is a black and white variation of the USA national flag (both blue and red colors replaced with black), with the white stripe beneath the canton being repainted into pink [2, 3, 4]. The same symbol is sometimes described as symbolizing the support to women in emergency services and in military, but the breast cancer awareness is definitely the dominant symbolism [5].

The flag with a pink horizontal stripe on black field seems not to have appeared yet, but the design is much used for the decals, pins and other items which can copy the flag design, so it is probably just a matter of time when such flags will be offered for sale.

This was certainly inspired by the Thin Pink Line Flag which stands for the breast cancer awareness. The only flag version currently known is the black and gray (""subdued"") variation of the USA national flag, the ratio being 2:3, with the stripe beneath the canton bearing the awareness colors [2]. While the source photo [2] confirms that the ratio is indeed 2:3, as stated at the page, it also shows that the flag looks as if it was originally made with the ratio 3:5 and subsequently shortened, for the purple segment of colored stripe is visibly longer than the teal one; however, the 3:5 variant seems not to exist yet, for it has not been offered for sale, so the presented flag image is made with the ratio as displayed and both segments occupying equal portions of the stripe, for there seems to be no sense in intentional making one longer than the other.

2/7/2025 13:29:15,[.] [USA] Black Lives Matter,"The following presentation of Black Lives Matter will try to discuss all aspects of this vexillological phenomenon - not only the flags used by their supporters, but also those used by their opponents, being related in the way which allows, even requires such an approach.
Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an international activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people. BLM regularly holds protests speaking out against police killings of black people, and broader issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system.
In 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag ""#BlackLivesMatter"" on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin in February 2012. First street demonstrations took place in 2014, following the deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza from Oakland, California, Patrisse Cullors from Los Angeles, California, and Opal Tometi from Brooklyn, New York, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.
Since 2015, there were BLM activities in other countries, such as Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom. On the other hand, rise of the movement has also inspired the counter-movements whose accusations range from inspiring hostility towards the police in general to promoting anti-white racism (regarding the latter, it shall be noted that such accusations are typically cast by white supremacists upon their opponents). Other critics of the BLM include perceived lack of focus on interracial violence, problematic statements about Israel (accusations for Israeli ""genocide"" against the Palestinians) and insufficient focus on female victims. (source: Black Lives Matter at Wikipedia)

The most widespread BLM flag is black (as shown above) with the words arranged in three rows, BLACK and MATTER inscribed in white and LIVES inscribed in black upon a white panel as shown above [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. While the typeface used is most frequently as shown here, it varies as well [8, 9, 10], but the text is always centered horizontally.

John Evosevic, 3 July 2002

The Black-Blue-Black design is usually seen on a policeman's personal car or family members car. It stands for the ""thin blue line"". There is also a similar one with a red strip for firemen.
Jim Popovitch, 17 August 2002

The black-medium blue-black flag is actually a police mourning band. It is typically worn as a band across the badge when an officer is killed in the line of duty. I have seen it in use more frequently now as a bumper sticker, I believe this is probably a show of respect for the police officers killed on September 11th.
Troy Corwin, 26 September 2002

This design is an identification to notify other law enforcement people that the bearer also works in law enforcement. It represents the ""thin blue line, or brother police officer. The identification of fallen officers uses a badge with black tape or a black elastic band around the center. It is usually only worn when an officer dies, and is worn for up to a week after death, not everyday use.
Bob Cunningham II, 8 May 2006

It is not just a mourning flag. It's origin is vague. In its earliest form, it was used to identify police officers, as mentioned above. The ""thin blue line"" of protection against evil. One story I heard was that in the event of a traffic stop, it let the approaching officer know that the person in the vehicle was a cop and might have a firearm. The current use is more of support for law enforcement.
Rick Wyatt, 2 June 2015

The three equal horizontal striped flag you are referring to is the original ""Police Mourning and Police Support Flag"" which first appeared around 2002. This flag actually began as a police mourning arm band used in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was at first typically worn when an officer was killed in the line of duty. It stood for the ""thin blue line"" of police protection. It evolved into an auto sticker and finally into a flag. It was also used as a show of respect for the police officers killed on September 11 and was also seen as a variant with a red stripe instead of a blue one for fire fighters. Since then versions with much thinner blue or red stripes, combined stripes, etc. have also been reported. A variant with the text ""Police Lives Matter"" was used in 2015 at a rally in Baltimore, Ohio. Since the original ""Thin Blue Line"" flag's appearance, apparently all emergency services are getting on the bandwagon resulting in a confusing collection of similar flags and a host of variants. And yes, they have become political, as flags often do.

2/4/2025 18:25:55,[ENG] West Riding of Yorkshire,"This new flag for the English region of Yorkshire was designed by Michael Faul, Editor of Flagmaster, the journal of the Flag Institute.  It shows the cross of St. George, the historic symbol of England, with the vertical band off-centre to the left, in the format adopted by most Scandinavian countries. This reflects the fact that Yorkshire is part of England, but also that it has close ties with Scandinavia, having been settled and ruled by Norwegians and Danes in the eighth and ninth centuries. The white rose is shown on a blazing sun, called ""rose-en-soleil"" in heraldry, which is the Royal badge of the Royal house of York, the last member of which to rule England was Richard III (1483-1485). The new flag has been adopted by the Campaign for Yorkshire which is campaigning for a Yorkshire parliament.
Michael Paraskos, 20 September 2002

You may be interested to know that the Yorkshire Dialect Society has adopted this flag and uses it as the masthead on its website. The Campaign for Yorkshire has also expressed interest in ""officially"" adopting it as the flag for the whole of historic Yorkshire (but has not yet actually done so). The centre of the rose is yellow, for the pollen stamens.

The flag shows the cross of St. George, the historic symbol of England, with the vertical band off-centre to the left, in the format adopted by most Scandinavian countries. This reflects Yorkshire’s Anglo-Scandinavian heritage, the county having been settled and ruled by Norwegians and Danes in the C8th & C9th as well as focussing the design on the hoist, westernmost, side. Placed at the centre of the cross is the traditional white rose of Yorkshire, in use since the fourteenth century, shown against a blazing sun, a heraldic combination known as a “rose-en-soleil”. The same combination of “rose en soleil” device and red and white colours appeared in the arms of the former West Riding Council of 1889-1974. The flag was chosen by a public vote, following a competition to design a flag for the West Riding which was launched on Wednesday 23rd January 2013 with the Dalesman Magazine.

The cross is set against a green field and in combination the three colours allude to the North Riding’s natural features; the green representing the large tracts of the famed North Yorkshire Moors National Park, while the blue and yellow reflect the North Sea coastline and such rivers as the Swale, Tees and Esk. The rose represents Yorkshire and also featured on the coat of arms of the former North Riding Council.

East Riding Flag – Winning Design
Posted on April 18, 2013 by andystrangeway

I am pleased to announce that the winning design of the East Riding flag competition was designed by Trevor and Thomas Appleton (a father and son), from Kirkburn, East Riding.

The flag is described as: “The white rose is displayed in the East Riding style. The blue represents the sea and the maritime activities. The green represents the rich agricultural land.”

The flag was unfurled this morning at Beverley Minster by myself and the Lord-Lieutenant. The unfurling was attended by the Lord-Lieutenant, the Vice Chairman of East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Chairman of  North Yorkshire County Council. At the unfurling my address outlined the background to the East Riding flag.

Although the Lord Mayor of Hull City Council was unable to attended the unfurling he provided the following statement: “happy to note that the East Riding is recognised with its own flag”. The Lord Mayor of the City of York Council sent his best wishes for an enjoyable and successful event and unfurling.

The flag will remain on Beverley Minster for the next few days and return the following week to allow everyone the opportunity to see our new flag.

Jason Saber, 19 April 2013

The white rose is displayed in the East Riding style (upside down from the usual Yorkshire rose). The blue represents maritime activities and the green represents agricultural industries. The blue is placed on the hoist side to represent the Riding’s connection to the whole of Yorkshire whilst the green is placed towards the fly to represent its position to the east. The flag was chosen by a public vote, following a competition to design a flag for the East Riding which was launched on Monday 7 January 2013 on BBC Radio Humberside. Six designs were selected from numerous entries, by a panel of judges, for everyone to vote for their favourite design.

It can be assumed to have the same meanings as the Greysexual flag stripes, but referring to Aromanticism instead of Asexuality:

Green: aromanticism
Gray: the transitional stage between aromanticism and alloromanticism.
White: alloromanticism.[3]
A Grey-Aromantic flag was proposed by deactivated tumblr user elodiefay on or before June 12th, 2014. The meanings of each stripe color are as follows:

Black: traditional color for aro/ace
Gray: for being gray-aro, or in-between aro and allo
White: for lack of attraction
Green: the “opposite” of red, the traditionally romantic color; and for respect to the aromantic flag.[4]
Another flag was coined by Angel on December 3rd, 2020. The darker shades represent occasional attraction, the mid-way shades represent being on the aro spectrum, the lightest shades represent feeling no romantic attraction, and the white represents community.[5]

Another flag was coined by Angel on December 3rd, 2020. The darker shades represent occasional attraction, the mid-way shades represent being on the aro spectrum, the lightest shades represent feeling no romantic attraction, and the white represents community.[6]

An additional Greyromantic flag was proposed by Apollo on November 21st, 2020.[7] The stripes do not have any meaning, but go from green to gray as a reference to the aromantic flag and spectrum.

On June 28, 2021, another Greyromantic flag was submitted by Nyoomster on the LGBTA+ wiki discord. The flag should recapture the feeling that comes with being in a grey zone, symbolized by the grey boarders surrounding the green colors of the aro spectrum. The greens have been given a slightly lighter and refined shade to hint at the uncertainty that may come with being greyromantic and to give it a more modern and easy to recognize look.

The creator of the greyromantic flag was (now deactivated) tumblr user lesbiandoe, who created it on (or before) September 22, 2014. This flag was based off of the greysexual flag made by Milith Rusignuolo and it's meanings, but using Green instead of Purple to represent Aromanticism (instead of Asexuality.) It has the following meanings:

Green: aromanticism
Gray: the transitional stage between aromanticism and alloromanticism.
White: alloromanticism.[1][2]
A flag with two grey stripes, one on top and one bottom. Sage-green stripes follow and light stripes of the same color are after them. There is a white stripe in the middle of all of the stripes.

The second flag was coined by Angel on December 3rd, 2020. The darker shades representing occasional attraction, the mid-way shades represent being on the aro spectrum, the lightest shades represent feeling no romantic attraction, and the white represents community.

The third flag was proposed by Apollo on November 21st, 2020. The stripes do not have any meaning, but go from green to gray as a reference to the aromantic flag and spectrum.

In August 2016 Tumblr user enbians created the first enbian flag[1]. In the same month, Tumblr user enbians made two variations of the enbian flag.[2][3]

In July 2017, Tumblr user non-birbnary created two variations of the first enbian flag[4][5].

In October 2017, Tumblr user the-ross-winchester created a nblnb/enbian flag based off of the nblw/trixic flag and nblm/toric flag[6].

In June 2018, Tumblr user nblnb created an enbian flag inspired by the-ross-winchester's enbian flag[7][8].

The three-horizontal-stripe alternative enbian flag was created by an anonymous wiki user on April 20, 2021. The plum stripes represent nonbinary love. The aster represents love, wisdom, faith, and color. The flag is designed to follow the same format as the sapphic, achillean, and diamoric flags, as well as other flags for juvelic orientations.

The demienbian flag was created by an anonymous wiki user on August 3, 2021. It is the aster enbian flag in the demi- flag format. The dark grey stripe stands for a-spec attraction. This flag can be used for sexual, romantic, and tertiary attraction.

In August 2016 Tumblr user enbians created the first enbian flag. It appears that it is the first mention of enbian as a whole, although its actual coining date is unknown.[2] enbians created an alternative version the first flag in the same month.[3] The purple gradient background represents how no two nonbinary genders are exactly alike, but can all coexist under one umbrella term, as long as the differences between them are acknowledged. The yellow moon represents how one’s feelings and self-perceptions can change over time and reflects the fluid nature of gender identity, which can be ever changing, or cyclical.[2]

The colorless circle represents how identification transcends human language, the ambiguous space between a feeling and an alignment, and an unbroken connection. The crescent moon and the circle together symbolize of the unity of two (or more) individuals who are bound together in love similarly to how light is bound to the moon. [2]

On July 18th, 2017, a revised version of the original flag was made by tumblr user non-birbnary and posted by tumblr user bigenders, it retains the symbolism and meanings of the original flag.[4]

On October 22nd, 2017, Tumblr user the-ross-winchester created a nblnb/enbian flag based off of the NBLW/Trixic flag and NBLM/Toric flags. The green and orange represent being nonbinary because they are the inverted colors of binary pink and blue. The white stripe represents loving nonbinary individuals because white (like in the trans flag) represents people outside of the gender binary.[5]

In June 2018, (now deactivated) Tumblr user nblnb created an enbian flag inspired by the-ross-winchester's enbian flag with the same color meanings.

It is unknown who created the commonly-used and alternate cisgender flags

The second alternate cisgender flag was designed by Fandom user M0TH3rY on April 26, 2023.[3]

A third cisgender flag was created by Fandom user AWeirdoWhoLovesAnimals on November 8, 2024.[2]

Two cisgender flags (including the most common pink and blue flag) were created on the same day by the same user.[3][4] The pink and blue flag is said to have been created as a heterosexual flag by arianod. However, it was posted with the title ""Straight/Cisgender"" flag. The flag with the white heart was given the same title. It is unclear if these flags were intended as cisgender flags, as heterosexual flags, or as a cisgender heterosexual flags. No additional information is given for either of them.

The alternate greyscale cisgender flag was created by DeviantArt user FlagsforCisHets on August 4, 2016.[5] It has no confirmed meaning.

A fourth flag was created by FANDOM user OMeera on June 8, 2021. The grayscale cisgender flag is depicted using black, and variations of gray. The heterosexual flag uses black and white (grayscale) to contrast with the rainbow flag.

A fifth flag was created by FANDOM user ThunderBrine on November 17, 2021. The cisgender flag is depicted using gray, and well as azure and rose on direct opposite ends on the flag, symbolizing gender isolation from each other, as if the color were to touch, it could be interpreted as gender questioning, or the midway point between identifying as cisgender and transitioning into transgender. There is also a flag with no cisgender symbols on them.

An alternate cisboy and cisgirl flag were created by stardusted-queerness on July 16, 2023. The creator created the alternatives without the inclusion of grey, as they felt that the color grey in the context of gender modality represented unimportance, or stereotypical normality - of which appears to designate cisgender as a bland or unimportant identity.[6]",https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Cisgender?file=Cisgender_Alt.webp#Flags,https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cisgender#/media/File:Cisgender_flag.svg,Social,2023,2,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Blue, Purple",Equal Distribution,"Blue, Purple",Purple,(There is no middle band),Blue,https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Cisgender,u/Geogrartist,[.] Pride Flags

1/31/2025 12:26:00,[POL] Frombork,"Frombork - urban-rural commune, Braniewo County, Warmińsko-Mazurskie Voivodship - German name: Frauenburg.
Gmina Frombork is an urban-rural gmina (commune) on the Vistula Lagoon, in Braniewo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodship, in northern Poland. Its seat is the town of Frombork, which lies approximately 11 kilometres (7 mi) west of Braniewo and 83 km (52 mi) north-west of the regional capital Olsztyn.
Area: 125.82 sq.km (48.6 sq.mi); Population: 3,791 (2006).
The former residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, the town and its 700-year-old cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war, Frombork was meticulously reconstructed and is again a popular tourist destination.

The town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prusian site. In 1224 at Catania, Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia directly subordinate to the church and Holy Roman Empire. Later in the same year the pope assigned Bishop William of Modena as the papal legate to Prussia. With the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini, the Teutonic Knights were granted control of the region, which they subsequently conquered. According to local legend, the Old Prusian inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meissen, a priest of the Teutonic Knights and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena.

Supposedly when the stronghold's lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named Frauenburg (""Our Lady's fortress"" in German). This name is not unique in German, but it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Marienburg, like the nearby Marienburg castle and city (now Malbork).

The village was first mentioned in a 1278 document signed by Bishop Heinrich I Fleming. On 8 July 1310, Bishop Eberhard von Neiße granted the town Lübeck city rights, as used by many member cities of the Hanseatic League. It was described, still rather unspecifically, as Civitas Warmiensis (Warmian city).

In 1329-1388, the magnificent Gothic cathedral was built, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, or ""Our Lady"" (in Latin, Domina Nostra; in German, Unsere Frau). Hence, the town was called Frauenburg. Over the centuries, the cathedral has been expanded and rebuilt repeatedly. There are also several other historic churches, dedicated to St. Nicholas, St. George, and St. Anne, all built in the 13th century.

In 1414 the city was plundered and burned during a war between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. In 1454, during the Thirteen Yearś War, the hill and its cathedral were occupied by Jan Skalski. By the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), it became an important city of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia and part of the Polish province of Royal Prussia

In the Middle Ages, the inhabitants were mainly merchants, farmers and fishermen. The most famous resident was the astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus, who lived and worked here as a canon (1512-16 and 1522-43). Copernicus is said to have jokingly called it ""Weiberstadt"" (""Wiveś Town"") or ""Gynepolis"" (in Medieval Greek). It was at Frauenburg that the astronomer wrote his epochal work, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Shortly after its 1543
publication, Copernicus died there and was buried in the town's cathedral, where his grave was thought to have been found by archaeologists in 2005. This was subsequently confirmed in November 2008 by the publication of the results of DNA tests on fragments of bone and hair found on the skeleton here that matched two strands of hair which belonged to Copernicus and are currently located in Uppsala University.

In the northwest corner of the cathedral grounds is Copernicuś tower, and in the southwest corner an octagonal building with a square bell tower and a small planetarium and a Foucault's pendulum. From atop the tower one can survey the town, the tiny harbor, the great panorama of the Baltic Sea, and much of Warmia's countryside.

After the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1772), the town was taken over by the Kingdom of Prussia. Subsequently, in 1871 Frauenburg became part of the German Empire. The Preußische Ostbahn railway line was opened in 1899 connecting Elbing (Elbląg) and Braunsberg (Braniewo) via Frauenburg, leading further to the Russian border at Eydtkuhnen (Chernyshevskoye). Passenger services on the railway line through Frombork ceased in early 2006.

Towards and after the end of World War II, the German inhabitants were either evacuated or expelled like most of the German population of East Prussia. At the end of World War II, after 173 years the city along with the rest of southern East Prussia, again became part of Poland once more under territorial changes promulgated by the Potsdam Conference. The town, renamed Frombork in 1946, was resettled by Poles, many of whom were expellees from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.

In 1959 Frombork regained its city rights. Having been heavily (70%) damaged in World War II, it was rebuilt by Polish Boy Scouts in 1966-1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Copernicuś birth.

Today, Frombork is regaining its importance as a tourist destination, abetted by its key location just south of the frontier with the Russian district of Kaliningrad. Although the railway through Frombork closed in 2006, the port has seasonal ferry connections with Elblag, Krynica Morska and Kaliningrad.

    * 1278 first mentioned
    * 1310 Lübeck law rights granted for Civitas Warmiensis
    * 1388 cathedral completed and dedicated to the Virgin Mary
    * 1466 Second Peace of Thorn (1466): now part of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia and Royal Prussia in Poland
    * 1772 First partition of Poland: now part of the Kingdom of Prussia
    * 1871 German Empire founded: now automatically a part of it
    * 1945 The Potsdam Conference places Frombork under administration of Poland pending a final peace conference, but since one never takes place, the decision effectively passes Frombork to Poland. The new borders are recognized by East Germany in 1950, accepted by West Germany in 1970, and confirmed by newly reunified Germany in 1990. (website & wiki)

Andorra's current flag was introduced in 1866 by adding a blue field to the yellow and red flag of Foix. By doing so, both France and Spain were represented with two colors in Andorra's flag (red and blue for France and red and yellow for Spain).

Volker Mörbitz Keith, 11 Apr 2000

The source of my image is the flag plate in Grand Larousse Illustré du XXe Siècle, 1932. Since several sources stated that the Andorran tricolor flag was adopted at the end of the 19th century, one may wonder why Larousse showed such an outdated flag, especially for a country which is geographically and politically so close to France. Talocci 1993 says the current tricolour flag replaced the former yellow-red flag in 1866, and attributes the new design to Emperor Napoleon III (reigned 1852-1870). The only source I know mentioning the adoption date as 1806 is Pedersen 1971, who says the colours were those of the Counts of Foix, in agreement with Herzog and Hannes 1990. Finally, there is a question which remains to be answered, what was the flag of Andorra before 1806?

Ivan Sache, 24 Nov 2001

The historical flag of Andorra, which was used from 1806 to 1866, featured two equally sized red and yellow vertical (sometimes horizontal) bands. It is claimed that this flag was granted by Napoleon in 1806 but use of the flag may go back to much earlier. Red and yellow are the traditional colors of the lands adjacent to the Pyrenees, such as Foix, Roussillon, Toulouse and Crown of Aragon.",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/a/ad1806.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Andorra#/media/File:Flag_of_Andorra_(1806%E2%80%931866).svg,Historical,1806,2,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Red, Yellow",Equal Distribution,"Red, Yellow",Red,(There is no middle band),Yellow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Andorra#First_flag,u/Geogrartist,Andorra
1/30/2025 22:01:32,[AND] Andorra (Civil Flag),"The flag of Andorra has been used from circa 1870 as a civil flag. The proportions are 2:3. The state flag (used on government buildings, etc.) has, in addition, the arms of Andorra on the yellow stripe.

Željko Heimer, 07 Nov 1995

Smith 1975 and Smith 1980 claim that the flag without the arms is the civil flag on land. Just the state flag has arms. So, it seems that general public should use the simple flag. However, as far as I know, there is no legislation in Andorra regarding the flag, so probably both versions are used interchangeably. Maybe influenced by similar tendency in neighbouring Spain, the version with the arms is now used more often – and also because the Chad/Romania problem. It may be that this is more showed outside of Andorra itself, resulting from the wish of many flag-hoisters (?) to have a different flag for each country.

Željko Heimer, 05 Mar 1997

As far as I can find out, there was no legislation defining the Andorran flag before (Title One, Chapter One, Article 5 of) the Constitution dated 4 May 1993, with further regulations dated 20 June 1996 (published 10 July) and those approved on 5 May 1999 upon which Željko obviously based his construction sheet. And none of these sources mention the existence of a plain civil flag.

Whilst I have little doubt that such flags have been in use over the last 150 years, the plain tricolour has (again as far as I can find out) no current legal existence (if it ever had) and therefore no regulated proportions (both internal and external) differing from those of the national flag (possibly because modern manufacturing techniques make the flag with arms very much less expensive than formerly?)

Christopher Southworth, 20 Jan 2010

There is a mention of a ""plain flag"" in both the Law of 10 June 1996 and the regulations of 5 May 1999.

Law of 10 June 1996 (Text in English at http://www.ompa.ad/angles/signes/Llei.PDF):

Annex 2. Traditional flag of Andorra

""(...) The coat of arms of the Principality of Andorra is placed in the centre of the flag, on the yellow stripe; however, it may be omitted, particularly when the flag is reproduced in certain small-scale or specific formats, such as tapes, where it may be represented solely by three adjacent stripes in blue, yellow and red.
The regulations [PDF] of 5 May 1999 also cite this ""plain flag"" (page 7):
En casos de cintes o de reduccions, s'utilitza la bandera sense l'escut, tal com es mostra a la fitxa 1.2.4 (aplicacions).
In cases of tapes or small-scale reproductions, will be used the flag without coat of arms, as shown on card 1.2.4 (applications).
This ""card"", or annex 1.2.4 is absent in the PDF file, so we would need the entire text to see what is represented there.
Obviously none of these states that this ""plain flag"" is the ""civil flag,"" or at least it isn't called ""civil flag.""

Antonio Gutierrez, 20 Jan 2010

We now know that a plain tricolour was formally authorized in 1996 and that (if made according to the Law) it should follow the pattern of that with the coat of arms - in proportions of 7:10 with unequal stripes (although how many flags are actually made that way is a matter of conjecture).

Christopher Southworth, 20 Jan 2010

I'm not sure that we're really talking about a flag in 7:10, here; I fear the ""tapes"" may merely refer to ribbons.

Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 21 Jan 2010

I don't quite know what ""tapes"" the law is referring to either, but it is quite specific with regard to the flag - it says that the arms ""...may be omitted, particularly when the flag is reproduced in certain small scale or specific formats etc."" This does not create a special flag, but simply says that the flag as regulated may be (under certain circumstances) displayed without arms, and the flag is regulated in a ratio of 7:10 with the stripes in proportions of 8-9-8.

Whether this flags or reproductions of it will ever actually be prepared using the official figures is open to debate, but (at least as far as I can understand it) the fact remains that they should be.

Christopher Southworth, 21 Jan 2010

A civilian variant of the flag is said to have been created in 1866, although the design was standardized in 1993 after Andorra joined the United Nations.

In 1093 given as a fief to Piast Family, then for some time ruled by Dukes of Opole. During rule of the King Premysl Otakar II. (of Bohemia) western part of Kladsko Territory joined Bohemia (today northern part of Náchod district with Broumov Town*-) and the rest was colonised by German settlers. Kladsko had special statute - its nobility wasn't part of Bohemian noble community, but it was subject to Kladsko Castle (to local burgrave / in Czech purkrabí, in German Burggraf). From 1278 ruled by Dukes of Wróclaw (Vratislav/Breslau), 1290 by Dukes of Swidnica (Svídnice/Schweidnitz), 1301 by Dukes of Minstrberk (Münsterberg, today Ziebice, Poland). Duke Boleslav II of Minsterberk sold Kladsko back to Kingdom of Bohemia.

In 1454 this territory was acquired by George of Podebrady, elected King of Bohemia and gave it to his sons. They were born before his royal election, that's why they were not entitled to inherit the throne. King made them Dukes of Minstrberk (Minstrberk Branch of Piasts was extinct) and Kladsko was in 1462 made County (Hrabství Kladské/ /Hrabstwo Klódzkie / Grafschaft Glatz). According to privileges from 1472 and 1578 this County should never be separated from Bohemia. But in 1500 it was bought by Duke Charles I of Minsterberk from his brother Count Albert and gave it to their Sister Zdenka (Sidonia), Countess of Hardegg. A nephew of her husband sold it back to Bohemia, then King Ferdinand II gave it to the archbishop of Salzburg; after the archbishop's death Ferdinand gave it to his brother Karl of Austria, bishop of Wróclaw (in German Breslau). Till the First Silezian War again part of Bohemia, in 1742 (Peace of Breslau) finally lost. Between 1742 and 1945 part of Prussian Province Silezia (Landkreise Glatz and Habelschwert/Bystrzyca Klódzka). The King of Prussia had also the title of Count of Glatz. Sincd 1945 district of Poland.

There have been many interpretations of what the pi symbol represents. Some think the pi symbol represents polyamorous people having ""infinite love"". Others say the pi symbol references how ""polyamory"" also starts with ""p"". It is also possible it was chosen partly because it was one of the few symbols available to Evans in Microsoft Paint.

1/28/2025 0:01:46,[IRE] Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,"The Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland probably did not have a distinguishing flag before 1821 when a Union Jack defaced with the Arms of Ireland was introduced by a royal warrant of 9 January 1821 for ships ""within harbours and waters of Ireland when Lt-General and Governor-General embarked."" When published in the Dublin Gazette of 22 March 1821 it was described as a Flag for the Lord-Lieutenant, and the area of use included St George's Channel (between Wales and Ireland).

The flag was introduced when the Admiralty objected to the practice of flying the Union Jack at the main masthead of any ship in which the Lord-Lieutenant was embarked. ""In former times the the Lt-General and General Governor were in the practice of wearing the Union Jack. In latter times the Union Jack has been appropriated to designate Military Command of the Admiral of Our Fleet and other Commanders-in-Chief. It is reasonable and necessary to make a difference between such a military flag and the honorary flag of the Lt-General and General Governor of that part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland called Ireland."" At sea the flag was third in precedence after the Royal Standard and the Flag of the Viceroy of India, and was ""to be always hoisted at the main, the flag of an Admiral or the broad pendant of a Commodore, if necessary, being shifted to another mast or ship as the case may require.""

The flag was also flown at the Viceregal Lodge when the Lord-Lieutenant was in residence, and at Dublin Castle when he was in residence or visiting, and on certain holidays. There may also have been a version of the flag, as used on land, that included a crown. In December 1902, Sir Arthur Vicars, Ulster King of Arms, wrote that an unauthorized flag of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland was sometimes used consisting of the Union Flag with a crowned harp in the centre, and in October 1924 T.P. Le Fanu at the Dublin Office of Public Works wrote that the flag that had been flown at the Viceregal Lodge when the Lord-Lieutenant was in residence was the Lord-Lieutenant's flag, a Union Jack with badge of harp and crown.

Flag shown by Norrie and Hobbs (1848) is a union jack with a yellow harp on a white (? or grey or silver) shield. Since such a shield would be metal on metal, it might be the field ought to have been coloured.

Governor General of Irish Free State
Between partition in 1922 and its demise in, I believe, 1937, the Irish Free State had a Governor-General. What flag, if any, did he fly? Did Southern Ireland (Eire) continue to have a Governor-General between 1937 and the establishment of the Republic in 1949 and, if so, did he fly the same pre 1937 flag?
Peter Johnson, 22 February 2005

I have never seen a reference to a special flag for the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. If there had been one, it would have been a defaced Union Jack until the early to mid-1930s, and then changed to a blue flag with royal crest and scroll. However I think it more likely that he used a plain Union Jack. In 1937, what was then called Eire, had a High Commissioner in London, so I presume that the British representative in Dublin would have had the same title ? I do not know whether he would have used a plain Union Jack or the flag of a British Ambassador, the Union Jack defaced with the royal arms. What flag does a British High Commissioner in a Commonwealth country use these days ? He is an Ambassador in all but name, but does he have an Ambassador's flag ?
David Prothero, 24 February 2005

I do not know what flag, if any, the GG of the Irish Free State flew, but numerous sources all confirm that the 1936 constitution, which took effect in 1937 abolished the office of Governor General and replaced it with a President as the head of state. For example, see http://worldatwar.net/timeline/ireland/18-48.html, http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/gdala.htm#g4, http://www.regiments.org/nations/europe/ireland.htm, or http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/Hennessy.htm among many others.

This was before the introduction of a blue flag with royal crest and scroll for Governor-Generals, but I have not seen anything to suggest that a flag of this pattern was ever produced for the Irish Free State.

Demerara-Mahaica - Region No. 4
The Demerara-Mahaica Region extends East of the Demerara River to the Western bank of the Mahaica River, and is predominantly low coastal plain, with a small portion of the hilly sand and clay region further inland.
The population is concentrated along the coastland, particularly in Georgetown, the capital city, which has a population of 56,095. The population of Region Four is 297,162.
Guyana's administrative and commercial activities are concentrated in this Region, especially in and around Georgetown, the main port. There are many sugar estates, such as Diamond, Enmore and La Bonne Intention, owned and controlled by the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GUYSUCO). Some residents of this region work on coconut estates, and many people have their own kitchen gardens. Cattle are reared in small amounts for beef and dairy purposes.

Flag Concept
Since Region 4 is the main economic centre of Guyana, the colours of the flag include red for the zeal and dynamic nature of the people, black for their strength and endurance and the symbol is the iconic Stabroek Clock.

The Essequibo Islands-West Demerara Region is made up of the islands in the Essequibo River such as Leguan and Wakenaam, and the Western portion of mainland Demerara. It is made up of low coastland, hilly sand and clay, and a small portion of forested highland regions. This Region has a population of 91,328 people who live in villages, many along the coast. Rice farming is predominant, with small amounts of sugar and coconut cultivation.
The Boerasirie Extension Project converted the Boerasire Conservancy and the Canals Polder Conservancy into a single reservoir, and reclaimed thousands of hectares of land, suitable for farming. The water from the conservancy is used during the dry seasons for irrigation. Sugar cane and coconuts are cultivated on a smaller scale and there is also beef and dairy farming.

The 42,769 people of this region live in Amerindian settlements and more established villages concentrated along the coast. The town of Anna Regina, on the west bank of the Essequibo River, grew out of a government land development scheme and is made up of former plantations such as Henrietta, Lima, La Belle Alliance. The Tapakuma Project in this Region links the Tapakuma, Reliance and Capoey lakes into one large conservancy, which supplies irrigation water for rice fields which dominate Region Two. One of Guyana's largest rice producers, Kayman Sankar Ltd operates in this region, producing rice not only for local consumption, but also for export to other countries of the world.

Barima-Waini - Region No. 1
The Barima-Waini region gets its name from its two main rivers. The region is predominantly forested highland, bordered at the north by a narrow strip of low coastal plain. Very few people live in Region One. There are just 18,590, who live
mainly in Amerindian settlements. Logging is the region's main economic activity. The largest logging operation is run by the Barama Company, which transports timber to Demerara to be processed into plywood. There are many other timber operations, as the tropical rainforest yields many species of hardwood and other useful types of wood. Mining for gold and diamond is also done in the forested area. Many porknockers set up dredges of various sizes.

The coast of Region One is known for its beaches, particularly Shell Beach, the only beach in the world to host four species of sea turtles during their nesting period from March to July. One type, the Olive Ridgley, is almost extinct. Another type, the Grant Leatherback, is the world's largest turtle. The Scarlet Ibis, the national bird of Trinidad and Tobago, is also a common sight on these beaches.

Cadle, a farmer from Homer, Illinois, proposed his version of the flag of Earth, that consisted of a blue circle representing the Earth, placed in the centre of the flag, in front of a segment of a larger yellow circle, representing the Sun, placed on the left side of the map, and a smaller white circle, representing the Moon, located in the right bottom corner of the flag, with everything placed on a black background. It gained popularity among the SETI researchers and is flown at numerous SETI research facilities around the world. Notably, the flag flies at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory, in Delaware, Ohio. On 23 December 1996, in honour of the death of Carl Sagan, three days prior, the flag had been flown there at the half-mast.
The flag was originally distributed by Earth Flag Co. International, which was founded by Cadle. The design had entered the public domain in 2003.

The symbol was introduced at Geneva in 1864, as a counter example to the crescent and cross used by two of Iran's rivals, the Ottoman and the Russian empires. Although that claim is inconsistent with the Red Crescent's history, that history also suggests that the Red Lion and Sun, like the Red Crescent, may have been conceived during the 1877–1878 war between Russia and Turkey.
Due to the emblem's association with the Iranian monarchy, the Islamic Republic of Iran replaced the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent in 1980, consistent with two existing Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols. Although the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran has in the past reserved the right to take it up again at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Red_Lion_with_Sun.svg/640px-Red_Lion_with_Sun.svg.png,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Red_Lion_with_Sun.svg/2560px-Red_Lion_with_Sun.svg.png,Movement,1922,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Yes, and it is not a bird",Lion,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Red, White",White,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement,u/glorioussealandball,United Nations

Therefore, in 1992, the then-president Cornelio Sommaruga decided that a third, more neutral symbol was required.
On 8 December 2005, in response to growing pressure to accommodate Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance, and blood bank service, as a full member of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, a new emblem (officially the Third Protocol Emblem, but more commonly known as the Red Crystal) was adopted by an amendment of the Geneva Conventions known as Protocol III, fulfilling Sommaruga's suggestion.

The red cross of the Saint George cross extends to the edge of the flag, whereas the red cross on the Red Cross flag does not.
The Red Cross flag is the colour-switched version of the Flag of Switzerland, in recognition of ""the pioneering work of Swiss citizens in establishing internationally recognized standards for the protection of wounded combatants and military medical facilities"". In 1906, to put an end to the argument of the Ottoman Empire that the flag took its roots from Christianity, it was decided officially to promote the idea that the Red Cross flag had been formed by reversing the federal colours of Switzerland, although no written evidence of this origin had ever been found.

The coat-of-arms (since 24th September 1957) shows the Bavarian lozenges and the [heraldic] panther from the arms of the Spanheim family. The unofficial flag is horizontally divided red-white with the arms in the center. There had been quite some discussion on the flag topic. The Bezirk was not happy with the suggested simply striped flag (communal flags in Bavaria have to be of two or three stripes, with or without the arms) and wanted to have something more distinctive. In 1961 a banner-of-arms was in the discussion, but also rejected by the Bavarian Hauptstaatsarchiv (Main State Archives). Later on the Bezirk obviously decided to use the first suggested flag (red-white), but without the approval by the Ministry of the Interior.

Later on I obtained information from the Bezirk to clarify the question of how the flag actually looks like, especially if it is used as a normal horizontal flag or as a hanging flag (Banner). The flag is used as a hanging flag of approximate proportion 3:1.

Does this mean that this Bezirk has only got a hanging flag, whereas the other Bezirke have only got horizontal flags? And where does the 11:3 ratio come from?
Santiago Dotor, 30 Jan 2001

The flags of the Bavarian Bezirke are based on Linder 1997 which is available online [but without images] at the Der Flaggenkurier website. He shows six of them as 'normal' horizontal flags, only the one of Oberbayern as a vertical flag. As both Dieter Linder and me live in Munich (the capital of Oberbayern) we both checked the flag of Oberbayern on our own, and Dieter Linder depicted a sketch of it in his article. I made several photos of the Oberbayern flag, and also measured it (it is 440 × 120 cm, i.e. 11:3 proportion). There is no official basis for this proportion; this flag is not even official, as already mentioned. I guess this is just what the flag manufacturer wanted to make. The Bezirk Oberbayern definitely does not use a horizontal 'normal' flag.

1/21/2025 17:15:56,[ESP] Mallorca,"The flag of Majorca is prescribed in Article 3.3 of Law No. 23 ""de capitalitat de Palma"", adopted on 20 December 2006 and published on 27 December 2006 in the official gazette of the Balearic Islands, No. 186 (text), as follows:

The official flag of Palma de Majorca shall be the one granted by King Sancho of Majorca, which features the Royal arms of the country and, in the upper part, the image of the castle in white on purple.
The flag is the Aragonese-Catalan flag - nine horizontal stripes yellow and red - with, along the hoist, a white castle rotated 90º counterclockwise on a purple field. On the central tower, an angel in black, haloed and holding a stick topped by a cross.
The castle represents the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the official residence of the Kings of Majorca, located in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic Islands.


The Palace of La Almudaina, which formed the earliest nucleus of the town of Palma, has been the main residence of the successive rulers of Majorca. Shaped like an irregular rectangle, the palace overlooks the lower town and the bay, constituting a convenient watch post. The palace is surrounded by a thick wall including 14 square towers of the same height but one; the higher tower has been known since the 14th century as the Angel's Tower, for the statue that surmounts it. Designed by the Catalan sculptor Arnau de Camprodón upon request of King James II (1276-1311), the statue represents the Guardian Angel who protected the town and the Kingdom of Majorca. Within the walls are located the Royal premises: the main hall, the king's chapel, dedicated to St. Ann, the queen's apartments, remains of the queen's chapel dedicated to St. John, cellars, and the king and queen's gardens.
A fortification already existed in the Roman period, but probably of much lesser extent, since the town of Palma had no special significance at the time. Accordingly, no detail on its architecture has been recorded. The historian Guillem Rossell&ocaute; Bordoy (b. 1932) provided evidence that the fortified wall was erected during the Muslim period, at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. At the time, the main fortress, of square shape and protected by thick towers, was located in the south-western corner of the area enclosed by the wall, that is, in the present-day's location of the Angel's Tower.
On 2 February 1115, Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer III (1086-1131) assaulted Medina Mayurca, partially destroyed the wall and entered the city. Severely damaged, the palace was rebuilt after the Christians' withdrawal. In the aftermath of the definitive conquest of the island, achieved in 1231, James II ordered in the beginning of the 14th century the revamping and increase of the palace, whose external aspect has been hardly modified since then.
In 1960-1970, José F. Conrado led a complete restoration of the palace, re-establishing its medieval aspect by removing accessory buildings erected in subsequent periods.

In 1309, King James II commissioned the sculptor Arnau de Camprodón to produce a statue of the Guardian Angel (Gabriel). The statue was to be placed atop a tower of the palace that was being rebuilt on the ruins of the Muslim fortress as the future official residence of the new rulers.
In January 2010, the sculptor when to Sineu, a town located in the center of the island, where the king had his palace - subsequently kept as his secondary residence. Documents provide evidence of detailed discussions between the artist and his patron about the design of the angelot. Back to Palma, the sculptor designed the frame of the statue in poplar wood, which he subsequently covered with brass sheets. According to José María Quadrado (1819-1896), the angel bears on the chest a plaque inscribed ""Et verbum caro factum est"" (John 1.14,The Word became flesh).
Once the sculptor completed the statue, 50 days later than promised, he transported it on a donkey to Sineu. Satisfied, the king ordered it would be placed on the highest tower of the restored palace, soon known as the Angel's Tower. The angel became the symbol of the kings of Majorca. The chapel of the royal palace of Perpignan is also surmounted with an angel. King James III placed an angel as the crest on his knight's helmet, as shown in the first miniature decorating the Palatine Law, a codex issued in 1337.
The island's people and institutions maintained the devotion to the Guardian Angel long after the suppression of the kingdom of Majorca. Among the four solemn festivals celebrated in Palma, the festival of the Guardian Angel was the most prized and attended. Organized by the municipality, the festival and procession disappeared in the middle of the 19th century.
[Bartomeu Bestard (official town chronicler). El Ángel Custodio y los reyes de Mallorca. Diario de Palma, 4 May 2014]

As shown on a black and white photo taken during the restoration of the statue performed in 1929-1930 by the sculptor Pedro Vila, the angel is haloed, holds in his left hand a long stick topped by a cross, and blesses the town from the right hand.
The angel was designed as a wind vane, therefore the local dictum, ""es como el Ángel del Palacio"", ""he is like the Palace's Angel"", referring to a whimsical person changing his mind like the angel changes his orientation according to the wind.

1/21/2025 17:11:56,[ESP] Menorca,"The flag of Minorca, adopted on 14 November 1983, is the Catalan flag with the coat of arms of the Universitat General, the name of the old and once only local administration of the island, offset to the hoist, going from the middle of the second yellow stripe to the middle of the fourth.

Jaume Ollé & Santiago Dotor, 3 September 1999

The Minorca Island's Council appointed on 8 August 1983 a commission, composed of four graduates in history - Andreu Murillo (1930-2007), Josep Manguán (b. 1952), Florenci Sastre (b. 1959), and Pilar Vinent (b. 1960) -, to redact a report on the symbols of the island and propose a flag of Minorca.
Based on search in the archives of Ciutadella, Maó-Mahón and Alaior, in bibliographical sources, and on the survey of emblems and coats of arms sculpted on different monuments and buildings or kept in the Ciutadella Museum, the commission presented the conclusions of their study to the Council on 15 September 1983, highlighting two main elmements.

1. The Catalan-Aragonese bars
No evidence of any flag proper to Minorca was found; there is, however, significant evidence of the use of the Catalan-Aragonese emblems all along the Christian history of the island.
The four-striped flag was present in 1232, when the Moorish rulers of the island plead allegiance to five Catalan knights. The royal emblems were formally imported to the island by Count of Barcelona Alfonso II the Liberal (1285-1291), who conquered the island from the Muslims in 1287. The four-pallet shield was sculpted on several buildings dated from the 14th to the 18th century: the vault of the Moon's Gate in the cathedral, keystones in the old St. Clare convent, the St. Roch Gate in Maó-Mahón, the gate of the St. Francis church in Ciutadella, the coat of arms of the old Universitat General (see 2., below), the entrance of the Town Hall of Alaior, and a keystone in the Town Hall of Ciutadella. Moreover, the governors of Minorca consistently used a four-pallet seal in the 16th and 17th centuries, and probably before; older seals were lost during the Ottoman raids on Maó-Mahón (1536) and Ciutadella (1558).

2. The coat of arms of the Universitat General
The Universitat General, located in Ciutadella, was the municipal administration of the island; in the 15th century, it was structured into four secondary universitats, located in Ciutadella, Maó-Mahón, Alaior, and Es Mercadal and Castell de Santa Agueda, which remained subordinated to the Universitat General. This municipal system was maintained until the beginning of the 19th century.
The arms of the Universitat General featured a fortified town, represented in three main variants:
- Seals appended to documents dated 1465 and 1556 feature the first version of the arms, matching the design sculpted in the main staircase of the Town Hall of Ciutadella and in the vault of the Moon's Gate of the cathedral. Confirmed in 1300 by James II, this seal was used until 1558, and subsequently used by Ciutadella as its municipal seal until the late 19th century.
- The Universitat General and the Ciutadella Universitat Particular used from the 16th to the 18th century the second variant of the arms. Orled by the inscription ""LA UNIVERSITAT DE LA ILLA DE MENORCA"", the seal features a tower topped by a staff surmounted by a cross potent and a vane pointing to the right. The tower surmounts a building and is surrounded by a pentagonal wall with a gate in the front and four angle towers leaning towards the central tower. On the left and right are placed to crowned shields of Catalonia-Aragón; the whole design is inscribed in an octagon with curvilinear sides.
- The seal used in the 19th century transports the perspective horizon of the former version; it was also used by the Ciutadella Health Service.

The commission concluded that the emblem used during the resettlement of Minorca in 1287 and since the infeudation of the island (1232) was made of four red stripes on a red field. To highlight the island's idiosyncrasy, the commission recommended to add the emblem of the old Universitat General to the four-striped flag to compose the flag of Minorca. The first version of the arms of the Universitat General should be preferred for the sake of seniority; it is, however, already used by the town of Ciutadella, and should be preferred the second variant, which would be specific to the island.

“There has been debate over the years as to the correct way to fly the Erne Flag. Some argue ""Green to the ground and blue to the sky"". However the accepted way is for the green stripe to be on top representing the land and the blue on the bottom representing the water. As the source of the Erne is in the Republic of Ireland with the main loughs in Northern Ireland, a more cynical interpretation is that the flag was designed to not offend anybody in that it is neither green/white/orange or red/white/blue!!! This flag is constructed of woven polyester and is approximately 24"" x 36"". Its designed to be flown green uppermost but you can fly it the other way if you wish.” See 1/3 of the following page showing the flag in action – green uppermost: http://www.iwai.ie/forum/read.php?1,21945,22036.

More on this Wikipedia page “Cross-border flag for Ireland”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-border_flag_for_Ireland
“This flag was initially used on the Shannon–Erne Waterway, which is bisected by the border. Rather than flying a national flag, boats fly this green, white and blue flag. It is endorsed by The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, an all-Ireland organisation.”

Very appropriately, the yearly Erne Boat Rally specifies: “No flags are to be flown during the Rally, with the exception of the Erne Flag and Burgees.”

1/21/2025 16:14:23,[IRE] Irish Republic (1916),"On 24 April 1916, a flag with the inscription 'Irish Republic' was hoisted alongside the Irish tricolour over the General Post Office, Dublin during the 1916 Easter Rising as a proclamation of the Irish Republic. A photograph was taken of it flying on the south-eastern corner of the GPO by a guest staying in the Metropole Hotel. ""It remained on the roof throughout the week, survived the bombardment and the fire which destroyed the G.P.O and was eventually removed by the troops after the insurgents' surrender, either on Sunday, 30 April or on the following day. A photograph taken at the time shows a group of soldiers holding it upside down at the base of Parnell monument in O'Connell Street. Thereafter, it was placed in the Imperial War Museum, London. It was presented by the British government to the Irish government on the fiftieth anniversary of the rising in 1966"".[1]	The flag features a green field with the inscription ""Irish Republic"" written in white and yellow (gold) letters in the form of Gaelic script.

The website at http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/rising-from-the-ashes-irish-republic-flag-on-display-1.2573071 carries an article about the banner symbolising events of Easter 1916 that survived the inferno at GPO almost intact. The best-known flag of the Easter Rising is not the Tricolour that flew over the GPO in 1916 but the Irish Republic one on display at the Proclaiming a Republic exhibition in the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks, Dublin. It is something of an achievement that the Irish Republic flag still exists. It hung from the flagpole closest to the Prince's Street side of the GPO and was shot at many times. It bears the scorch marks of the inferno inside. The flagstaff was hit on the last day of the Rising and the flag was found lying on the roof of the GPO.

Restoration
It was made from wool and house paint and bore the letters ""Irish Republic"" in white and orange on a green background. A man named Theobald Wolfe Tone Fitzgerald painted it in the home of Constance Markievicz in Rathmines. The flag was taken down from the roof on the day after the Rising and was regarded by the troops as quite a trophy. A famous photograph of the time shows troops from the Royal Irish Regiment posing with it at the Parnell Monument. It was taken to Britain, but given to the State by the Imperial War Museum to mark the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966. It needed serious restoration before being exhibited in the National Museum of Ireland's Proclaiming the Republic exhibition. The house paint had to be consolidated and preserved to make it safe for display as the prime exhibit. Also included in the exhibition is the Starry Plough flag, the symbol of the Irish Citizen Army, which flew opposite the GPO at the Imperial Hotel. The National Museum of Ireland has gathered, for the first time, all the remaining flags that flew over the rebel garrisons during Easter Week 1916, with the exception of the flag which flew over the College of Surgeons. That is in private hands.

Tricolour
What remains of the Tricolour that flew over the GPO is also on display, but it consists of only a couple of butterfly-shaped torn fragments. It was scorched in the fire and then rubble fell on it. The exhibition includes the Red Cross flag which was placed on the back of a Guinness lorry that was used to ferry the injured people to hospital during Easter Week.

1/18/2025 18:20:08,[BTN] Bhutan (Variant),"When I watched pictures of the recent coronation carefully, and googled some pictures about Bhutanese national flag, I noticed that a new rendition of dragon is depicted on newly taken photographs of Bhutanese national flag. The dragon has a different shape, it has some ribbon-like devices around its waist. Does anyone information about this change?
Zoltan Horvath, 4 October 2014

The Royal Bhutan Army flags page (http://www.rba.bt/flag) depicts a similar headquarters flag, but with a dragon very similar to the one I reported above.
Zoltan Horvath, 4 October 2014

 I don't know if this flag follows some new rules. It could also be some artistic license, something I have seen sometimes on Tibetan flags. I have tried to check if there was any new official design but I couldn't find any. According to Wikipedia, the constitution of Bhutan of 2008 is available at https://www.constituteproject.org. The ribbon-like devices are probably fire streams or clouds.
Corentin Chamboredon, 4 October 2014

Jos Poels reported in 2012 the aborted process of adoption of a flag law. I imagine that there has been no significant progress on that matter, otherwise Jos would have told us.
Ivan Sache, 5 October 2014

I found one more variant of the Bhutanese National Flag, where the dragon is depicted as a colorized version: http://images.tmcnet.com/featurestory/ap/2011/10/15/Bhutan-Royal-Wedding-JPEG-2.jpg and http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Penjor+Bhutan+Celebrates+King+Marries+xLSW6kJHDfIl.jpg at http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/ZpLVpf9WA54/Bhutan+Celebrates+King+Marries/xLSW6kJHDfI/Penjor. (These pictures were taken during the wedding celebrations in 2011.) Note under the picture says, it is the National Flag, but it's not, because there is a simpler white dragon on that one, not a colorized one. Or is it the Royal Flag of Bhutan? Please see http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/King+Jigme+Khesar+Namgyel+Wangchuck+Bhutan+Q1gv65Vabk5l.jpg where the same person offered this flag to the King or does the King bless it?
Zoltan Horvath, 13 October 2014

Very interesting, although I have no idea of what this flag could be. Could it be that the dragon should theoretically be in color but isn't in most of the cases if the flag is too small? It would then be a sort of high-quality flag.
Corentin Chamboredon, 13 October 2014

I doubt he's blessing it; his pose doesn't seem right for that. Anyway, at http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/ZpLVpf9WA54/-/EPJfjNWvtOG is a second image, but I think they are out of order. The royal couple is offered mar-chang. When the mar-chang is removed a flag is offered in its stead. So, I guess this tells us that it's a ceremonial flag. Why it has that exact pattern, you'd have to ask.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 15 October 2014

Regarding the mar-chang, this is not only offering but blessing also as a part of the ceremony. Please see note 19 at: http://books.google.com/books?
Zoltan Horvath, 16 October 2014

 I found some information about the marchang ceremony in Yul and Yul lha : the territory and its deity in Bhutan, an article of the Bulletin of Tibetology nÂ°1, volume 40 of 2004, by FranÃ§oise Pommaret, p. 59: https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/id/637339/bot_2004_01_02.pdf/

The worship of the deity of the territory mays also include a mar chang ceremony. It is a ceremonial offering of alcohol, butter and an arrow to protective as well as local deities. A large copper or bronze vat containing alcohol is placed on a stand in front of the person representing the lord or high authority of the territory. The vat is ornamented with horns made of butter. The master of the ceremony who stands in front of the vat facing the lord, offers a ladle of alcohol while saying a short prayer. Then he brings the lord a long arrow (mda' dar) wrapped in pieces of cloth of five different colours. The lord quickly touches it, ending the short ceremony, which is clearly at the same time a ritual of propitiation and allegiance to the deities. Besides this particular occasion, the mar chang is also performed in many other circumstances and there is no official function in Bhutan which does not include a mar chang. To my knowledge, this ceremony has not been mentioned in any ethnographic or historical writings about Tibet, although the symbolism and role of the arrow is well documented.

There is one more image of the color-dragon flag used during the wedding ceremony, but in this case all elements of dragon are visible more clearly than on the previously posted pictures: http://photogallery.indiatimes.com.

The UNPO flag was adopted on 5 August 1991 at the second UNPO General Assembly. At the first GA on 11 February 1991 it was decided to call on all present members to design both a flag and a symbol for UNPO. At the time of the second GA both a flag and a symbol were adopted, however over the years the flag was deemed not clear enough to identify UNPO, which was the reason why the logo was more often used than the flag. In 2005 it was decided to combine the flag and symbol into a new flag.
Jeroen Zandberg, UNPO Secretariat, 15 January 2009

""The logo of UNPO was the result of an open competition in which Mr. Qenan Sheji (of Albania) made the winning design. As far as I know, UNPO did not adopt a new flag in 2002. The flag without the UNPO name in the middle was sometimes used before and after that time and I am not completely sure why this happened, but the official flag is the one that is attached and it is usually behind a deep blue background; also see the photo's on our website.

The aegoromantic flags were coined by pride-color-schemes on June 26, 2016. They have no confirmed meaning.

The alternate flag was coined by Cryptocrew on February 26th of 2021. The shades of green represents romantic orientation while the black triangles represents a wall in between ones romantic attraction and themself. The grey X represents the greyromantic spectrum.


The other alternate flag was made by MYGENDERISNOANDYES‬ was made on June 7th 2022 and posted here on June 10th 2022.

The salmon colors represent the romantic ideals and the shades of gray represent lack of need or lack of attraction, the white color represents platonic relationships.

The first stripe with mostly dark gray with some dark salmon represents, liking the thought of romantic relationships.
The second stripe with mostly light gray with some light salmon represents liking the thought of romantic actions(Kissing, going on dates etc.)
The third stripe which is fully white represents platonic relationships.
The fourth stripe represents with mostly light gray with some light salmon represents lack of attraction or need for a romantic relationship.
The fifth stripe represents lack of attraction or need for romantic actions.

1/16/2025 23:21:49,[USA] 13 Star Flag (1777-1795),"During the Revolutionary War, numerous flags were used. After the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776, the people realized they needed one flag to replace all the assortment of flags used previously. On 14 June 1777, the Continental Congress adopted the following resolution:

""RESOLVED, that the flag of the 13 United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: That the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.""
Because the resolution was not specific there were a number of variations of the 13 star flag.
Although legend has it that Betsy Ross sewed the first flag from a design by George Washington, this has not been substantiated. The first documented U.S. flag was the staggered star pattern shown above. A strong case for the designer of the first flag is Francis Hopkinson. A delegate from New Jersey to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He submitted a bill to Congress for ""currency designs, design for the great seal of the U.S., a treasury seal, a design for the flag ...""

This flag is a ""typical"" 13 star flag of the early period. Although there were countless variations, this one shows some of the common traits. Specifically, note that the stars point every which way. This was common prior to the last quarter of the 19th century.

Jose Antonio Jimenez, 30 November 2012
For the colour of the upper fly field, I am still in doubt. The most recent source, the Flags of Paradise poster, has the upper field as blue, whereas all the other, older, sources agree that it is black. Is there a chance that the flag may have been changed at some point, and that the flag with the blue upper fly field is the new/current version?
Jan Oskar Engene, 13 October 1998

I have two sources which are contradictory of each other. A book entitled PNG: A fact book on modern Papua New Guinea by Jackson Rannells, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1990 has as its cover design the provincial flags of PNG. For East New Britain it shows a flag divided diagonally Blue over Red with a Green stripe and the arms outlined in red with a blue triangular figure and a black/white mask figure.

Wolfgang Jilek presented a paper at the 12th International Congress of Vexillology entitled Symbols in New Guinea - Tribal, Colonial, National and Provincial. Herr Jilek, if I recall correctly, had an extended stay in PNG working on an aid project. The Congress Papers (published as Flag Bulletin XXVIII:1-4/130) show at page 206 a description of ""divided per bend with a green stripe between a black field with four Southern Cross stars and a red field. A central red ornamented white disk bears the mask of the Duk-duk secret society of the Tolai and the ningum fire dance mask of the Baining.""

I believe that Wolfgang Jilek's paper is the most likely to be correct.

Ralph Kelly, 13 October 1998

A green stripe separates red and blue triangles. Four white stars over the blue represent the national flag. Traditional shell money surrounds a circle.

1/14/2025 16:28:35,[JER] Jersey (1830-1981),"This flag is often described as a St. Patrick's cross.

Although St Patrick had nothing to do with Jersey, a red saltire on a white ground is commonly called St Patrick's cross. There may not be any sound evidence linking Saint Patrick, as a person, to a red saltire on white, but the connection, between St Patrick, as a name, and a red saltire on white, was made when the Order of Saint Patrick was established in 1783, and extended when the term ""Crosses Saltire of St Andrew and St Patrick"" was used in the blazon of the Union Jack in 1801.
David Prothero, 25 January 2001

According to ""Portrait of the Channel Islands"" by Raoul Lemprière, 1970 [i.e., before the advent of the current flag], p.155, in the middle of a discussion of flag and arms in use on the Channel Islands, it is stated,

""In Jersey the Union Jack is flown from the flagstaff on the western bastion of Fort Regent. By tradition the flag is never half-masted except on the death of the Sovereign. The lieutenant-governor of each bailiwick has his official flag, which is the Union Jack with the arms of the Bailiwick at its centre. In Jersey it is flown from the flagstaff in the grounds of Government House at all times when His Excellency is in the island; it is never half-masted unless the lieutenant-governor dies and is only hauled down when he leaves the island or vacates his appointment. The flag is also flown on the bonnet of the l-g's motor car when he is travelling about the island and from the masthead of any ship in which he is embarked. Similar remarks apply to Guernsey.

The Jersey flag is the cross of St. Patrick, which is described heraldically as a saltire gules on a field argent. The insular colours of red and white are presumably derived from those of the flag. It would appear that the cross of St. Patrick became the Jersey flag as the result of a mis-reading of an entry in an 18th century book of charts. It is not possible to prove the adoption of the flag before about 1841.
Jarig Bakker, 27 October 2005

Reports of the use of the flag
In what period has the St. Patrick's cross been used in Jersey?
Nozomi Kariyasu, 21 January 2001
Since about 1830 until the shield was added in 1981. Several lines of evidence exist for its use in this period:

Here is an extract from the translation of a letter written by the Bailiff of Jersey to the Lt-Governor in 1906: ""As I have stated in previous correspondence the distinguishing flag formerly used by Jersey vessels - notably during the period (extending over several centuries) throughout which the Channel Islands enjoyed the privilege of neutrality in the wars between England and France (as to which consult Le Quesne's Constitutional History in Durell's edition p.p. 116-174 and Notes p.428-9) to ensure immunity, was the red St Andrew's cross on white ground, to this day called, and in local use as, the 'Jersey Flag'. Venables Vernon."" Public Record Office, HO 45/10061/B2262.
David Prothero, 22 January 2001
The Bailiff of Jersey's reference to its earlier use is very vague. One might guess that he is perhaps referring to what is known as the Hundred Years War of the 14th and 15th centuries. A letter written by the Secretary to the Government of Jersey in 1938, quoted in Flag Bulletin Jan/Feb 1983, refers to a Papal Bull granted by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-1484) confirming the privilege of neutrality, but its significance in relation to the flag is disputed. I shall see if I can borrow a copy of the book that is mentioned by the Bailiff.
David Prothero, 25 January 2001

A flag book called Neptune François published at Amsterdam in 1693 showed a red saltire on white as the Irish flag. This was copied by several later publications. A Dutch book of 1700 (De Doorlughtige Weereld) says the following: 'Yrland heeft een witte Vlag, met een rood Andries Kruys' ('Ireland has a white flag, with a red Andrew's cross'). This publication seems to have had one interesting effect: the illustration of the red saltire was captioned 'Ierse' ('Irish') in this and in later Dutch publications. An English author, Carington Bowles, misunderstood the Dutch caption and showed the red saltire as the flag of Jersey in his Universal Display of the Naval Flags of all Nations (1783), thereby giving the island the flag which, slightly modified, it still uses.
Vincent Morley, 20 January 1997
The theory about the origin of the flag quoted above is, I submit, of dubious value. This is NVL Rybot's theory which is hotly disputed. No evidence has ever been presented to show that the flag was adopted by Jersey after the Dutch mix-up, or any reason why a flag with no administrative status should be whole-heartedly adopted by a French-speaking population on the basis of a Dutch/English linguistic confusion. The case that the Dutch were confused simply because Jersey and the Irish were indeed using the same simple device has never been refuted. There is a theory that the red saltire was adopted by Jersey ships at an earlier period as a variation of the cross of St. George in order to distinguish themselves from English ships and thus demonstrate their neutrality.

The clinching argument for the adoption of a new flag was that the traditional red saltire had never been proclaimed officially and that its use was simply traditional custom. The traditional flag was supposedly not distinctive (or 'distinguished') enough to be adopted officially. The question of the new flag raised passions. Many saw no need for the flag to be changed at all. A strong body of opinion would have preferred les trois léopards (the Island's three leopards) simply shown on the flag - or possibly the two leopards of Normandy. The flag with the three leopards (gules three lions passant guardant) is indeed the one that hangs over the Bailiff's chair in the States chamber. The current flag appears therefore to be a compromise between different opinions.

This flag is in Norie/Hobbs (1848), on the flagchart of Laurie (1842) on p. 70 of Wilson's Flags at Sea (1986), and discussed extensively by Carr/Barraclough in ""Flags of the World"". In my opinion the reference in these books to the St. Patrick's cross looks spurious, based on references in Irish history books, and dubious images on Dutch flagcharts, where 'Ierse' might be read as 'Jersey'. However the images of Norie/Hobbs 1848 and Laurie (1842) seem to indicate that by that time the Jersey flag was used extensively - while it is not present on previous British flagcharts in Wilson's book.
Barraclough's ""Flags of the World"", 1971 has this to say: ""Jersey uses a white flag charged with a red diagonal cross. Although this flag has yet to receive the formal recognition of H.M.Government it appears to have been established as the island's territorial flag for well over a century. (...) This flag is flown on all official occasions on public buildings, as well as on business establishments.
Jarig Bakker, 21 January 2001

The international flag book by Christian Pedersen (1971) mentions that Jersey state flag - the same as the St.Patrick's Cross-has been used as the territorial flag of the island for just over a century,without however being formally recognized by the British Government. He also mentions that Jersey Lieutenant Governor's flag is the Union Flag charged in the centre with the arms used by the States of Jersey,which are identical with the first and fourth quarters of Arms of England. These are placed on a white roundel within a green garland.
Nozomi Kariyasu, 26 January 2001
Flags & Coats of Arms by William Crampton (1985) mentions that the flag of Jersey has a white field charged with a red saltire of St.Patrick and in the top triangular field there is a red shield with three gold lions passant guardant (this was granted to the island as a seal by Edward I in 1279) ensigned with the crown of the Plantagenets and in this form the flag was approved on 7 April 1981 and without the arms it was used unofficailly for a hundred years.
So I assume that the flag without arms were used c.1870 until 1985.
Nozomi Kariyasu, 26 January 2001

It is interesting to recall that when the Channel Islands were occupied by Germany during World War II, this flag was worn as an ensign by ships carrying passengers and cargo between the islands - the use of the Red Ensign being, for obvious reasons, out of the question!""

The defaced Red Ensign which was abolished in 1935 and restored by a royal proclamation on 18 September 1971.
Pascal Vagnat, 25 September 1998.

Until 1968 the only official British flag that related to the Isle of Man was that of the Lieutenant Governor. This was the Union Flag defaced in the centre by a gold trinacria on a red shield on a white disc surrounded by a laurel leaf garland. The land flag, a gold trinacria on a red flag, was authorised 9 July 1968. The Red Ensign was authorised on 27 August 1971. Any Isle of Man Red Ensigns before this date were probably based on the not uncommon misconception that badges on Union Flags, Red Ensigns and Blue Ensigns are interchangeable.
David Prothero, 13 August 1999

Barraclough and Crampton say on p.49: ""On 18 September 1971 the Manx Red Ensign was restored for use by all ships registered in the Isle of Man"" but infuriatingly give no other details. None of my other books mention a previous Manx Red Ensign.

I received from the Isle of Man Marine administration a CD telling all about Isle of Man Ship Registry. On the CD are a couple of photos of different ships specifically using the Isle of Man red ensign as a jack. Can anyone comment on this practice?

Pedersen (1970) also shows the merchant ensign, a red ensign with the Union Flag in the canton and a clockwise triskelion, with its centre in the middle of the fly half taking up most of that fly half.

Before that? Flaggenbuch (1992) shows the badge only for the Governor of the Isle of Man. In Fahnen und Flaggen (1939), however, Neubecker shows a Red Ensign with a Saint George cross in a, squarish, canton and the field filled with a yellow counter-clockwise triskelion. The shape of the emblem is a bit odd, as if the upper leg was move to make room for the canton. The text gives this as an 18th century example of flags with a governmental canton.

Siegel - Die Flagge (1912) also shows for the Isle of Man a Red Ensign with a Saint George cross in a, squarish, canton and the field filled with a similar, yellow, triskelion with in this case one clockwise foot and two counter-clockwise. For this 18th century flag, he gives the usual sources: Kieboom, Recueil and Bowles.

Between the two blades of the sword is a six-pointed star. The star may be confused with the Star of David, a Jewish symbol. However, in medieval times, this star was a popular Islamic symbol known as the Seal of Solomon and was widely used by the Beyliks of Anatolia. The seal was later used by the Ottomans in their mosque decorations, coins and the personal flags of the pashas, including Hayreddin Barbarossa. One of the Turkish beyliks known to use the seal on its flag was the Jandarids. According to the Catalan Atlas of 1375 by A.

The coup occurred amid the wider Rwandan Revolution, a period of social change and ethnic violence between the Tutsi minority and Hutu majority.[34] Grégoire Kayibanda, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, proclaimed a new national flag: a vertical tricolour of red, yellow, and green.[35][36] The design was identical to that of the flag of Guinea; a black ""R"" was consequently added to the centre in late September 1961 to distinguish it.[3] The flag was retained upon Rwanda's independence from Belgium on 1 July 1962.[3]

The colours of the flag held the following significance: red represented the blood shed for liberation, yellow represented peace and tranquillity, green represented hope and optimism, and black represented gloom and mourning.[3][4] The ""R"" stood for Rwanda, revolution, and referendum.[3]",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/r/rw-1961.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Rwanda#/media/File:Flag_of_Rwanda_(January_%E2%80%93_September_1961).svg,Historical,1961,3,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Green, Red, Yellow",Equal Distribution,"Green, Red, Yellow",Red,Yellow,Green,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Rwanda#1961%E2%80%932001_flag,u/Geogrartist,[RWA] Rwanda (1961-2001)

1/10/2025 22:54:14,[.] Surrender Flag,"Origin
First mentions before widespread, Early Imperial China and Roman Empire
The first mention of the usage of white flags to surrender is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (CE 25–220). In the Roman Empire, the historian Cornelius Tacitus mentions a white flag of surrender in CE 109. Before that time, Roman armies would surrender by holding their shields above their heads.[2]

Widespread adoption in the Middle Ages, the Capet Dynasty
During the Middle Ages and in a political environment centered on oaths, participating in another lord's banner or standard signified changing allegiance and loyalty. Thus, armies would waive the banner of the opposite side to signal surrender.

The French Capetian dynasty utilized a prominent white banner during this period, referred to at the time as the oriflamme.[3] As head of House Capet, Philip II adopted a single white flag as the family's emblem, still closely identified with the Kings of France for several generations. ""Its very name - a derivation of 'golden flame' - shows that it was intended from its inception to represent the French crown"".[4]

This meaning is affirmed a few years later during a subsequent conflict between the French monarchy and the English throne. At the siege of Fréteval castle in 1194, the English knights defending the castle ""came clad in white tunics, barefoot, holding up white cloths"" to King Philip and his invading army to indicate their surrender.[5] The color white, synonymous with the royal Capet flag, demonstrated the way medieval visual symbolism intertwined with feudal expressions of submission and dominance.

Through the 13th century, the precedent of utilizing white flags and banners to surrender to the French continued to proliferate after many French victories and across medieval Europe as Philip Augustus expanded the royal domain. Matthew Paris notes how during a 1231 rebellion against King Henry II of England in Wales, the princes pleading for mercy ""came before him bearing the king's white banner"".[6] This correlated the white flag with signaling transition of land or rulership.

Thus, the original meaning of waving a white flag was deeply tied to feudal custom, acknowledging and pledging loyalty or sanctuary to a specific lord and his noble standard. By the later Middle Ages, however, the distinct connection of the white symbol to House Capet and French royalty diminished as it gained wider currency as a gesture indicating any general surrender or truce between opposing armies regardless of feudal loyalties.

Through diffusion over time and across Europe, the white flag of the Capets, became divorced from a strict embodiment of Capetian suzerainty in war. Regardless of its shifting meaning, the basis of the tradition itself clearly originated in 12th century medieval France.[7][8][9][10]

During the renaissance the white flag was widely used in Western Europe to indicate an intent to surrender. The color white was not used as the colors of the king of France anymore but instead to generally indicate a person was exempt from combat; heralds bore white wands, prisoners or hostages captured in battle would attach a piece of white paper to their hat or helmet, and garrisons that had surrendered and been promised safe passage would carry white batons.[11]


Its use may have expanded across continents, e.g. Portuguese chronicler Gaspar Correia (writing in the 1550s), claims that in 1502, an Indian ruler, the Zamorin of Calicut, dispatched negotiators bearing a ""white cloth tied to a stick"", ""as a sign of peace"", to his enemy Vasco da Gama.[12] In 1625, Hugo Grotius in De jure belli ac pacis (On the Law of War and Peace), one of the foundational texts in international law, recognized the white flag as a ""sign, to which use has given a signification""; it was ""a tacit sign of demanding a parley, and shall be as obligatory, as if expressed by words"".[13]",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/v/vxt-d1170.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag#/media/File:White_flag_of_surrender.svg,Surrender,"First introduced in 25, officially adopted in 1899",0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,0,(No Stars),White,Equal Distribution,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag#,u/Geogrartist,Additional Flags

As such ideas did also exist in French Togoland/Togo, that has been producing some tension between Togo and Ghana, as was being reported a number of times.

""People Of Volta Region Declare Independence From Ghana, Set To Name Their Ministers, Currency, Flag & Others""

NOVEMBER 18, 2019
An interesting yet volatile development is brewing in Ghana emanating from the Volta Region which could potentially plunged the country into chaos. From what we gathered from Mynewwgh.com, the separatists from the Volta Region have officially detached themselves from Ghana after declaring independence. The website adds that the Homeland Study Group Foundation declared independence for the Volta, and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions after its meeting held in Ho.
Its shadow Minister of Information and Spokesperson George Nyakpo revealed on Starr FM that now that the independence has been declared, measures are being put in place to ensure that they are recognized as a state independent of Ghana. In the interim, he hinted ""we will notify the United Nations of our independence and seek recognition and will require a lot of support from the world body to succeed.""
Meanwhile, Octogenarian leader of the separatist movement in his inaugural speech disclosed that the new state can now boast of its own currency, coat of arms, among other things and cited the recent omission of roads in the Volta Region from the Critical Roads list in the 2020 budget.

On a green background as the colour of the city gardens there is painted a Magen David, the ancient symbol of the Jewish nation. Around it seven stars are shining, remembrance of the seven stars in the flag which Herzl proposed to the Jewish state which symbolizes the seven-hour working day. The Magen David is lightened by the rays of the shining sun, symbol to the light and heat which our country blesses with, and a hint to the rising new day of Israel nation in his homeland. On the background of the sun there is a palm tree, one of the seven characteristic species of the country crops. Plough shafts to the width of the emblem are a token to the agricultural past of the city. Piles of bricks on the bottom right symbolize the building momentum in Ramat Gan. The three trees rising between the bricks are coming to remind us that we are talking about a garden city, and the chimney on left is a symbol to the industristrial plants that were established in the city.

Željko Heimer, 3 February, 2003

The Civil Ensign of the Republic of China was already abandoned with the Executive Order by the authority in 1966. The Order said, ""During 'Period of Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion', the Civil Ensign should be suspended and replaced with the National Flag."" From then on, the Ensign was no longer flown even though the Period was terminated in 1991.
What mentioned above is replied from the Ministry of Transportation & Communications of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to answer the question about validation/invalidation of the Civil Ensign.

In late June 2020, former Governor Phil Bryant suggested using the bicentennial flag as a future state flag.

1/9/2025 20:35:36,[USA] Maine Bicentennial Flag,"In 2019, Maine lawmakers introduced a bill to adopt a simpler flag for the state, based on the original 1901 flag. A flag with a buff background, a blue star, and green pine tree from the Merchant and Marine flag, created by the Maine Flag Company, was one of the proposed options. Maine resident Jeff Van West also submitted a design for the new flag. His flag had a white star on a dark blue of a night sky over a lighter blue representing the rivers, ponds, and oceanfront of Maine. He had the tree extend off the flag border to give the feeling of being in the forest looking out over the water.

The measure to change the state flag failed. However, the legislature approved creating a flag for Maine's Bicentennial in 2020. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap submitted three designs for public comment: one of his own design, one using the Maine Bicentennial Committee logo, and a third based on Van West's flag, but replacing the white star with the red/gold/white Dirigo Star from the state flag. After the third design won the contest, Van West offered Dunlap a further revision replacing the multicolored Dirigo Star with a monochromatic white version. Dunlap approved that design as the Maine 2020 Bicentennial Flag.

A grass-roots movement to adopt a modernized version of the 1901 flag has since sprung up.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Maine_Bicentennial_Flag_%282020%29.svg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Maine_Bicentennial_Flag_%282020%29.svg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Maine_Bicentennial_Flag_%282020%29.svg,Anniversary,2020,2,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1,White,"Blue, Green, White",Blue,Blue,Blue,(There is no middle band),Blue,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Maine#Bicentennial_Flag_of_2020,,[USA] Maine

1/8/2025 22:09:53,[IRE] [UK] Royal National Lifeboat Institution,"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), founded over 150 years ago, is a voluntary organization that provides Britain's main offshore rescue service, backed up by helicopters from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. When a distress signal is received from a ship in British waters (or nearby) the nearest suitable lifeboat is launched, manned by volunteer lifeboatmen.
Graham Bartram, 7 July 1997

The house flag of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was introduced in 1884. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution itself was founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck and changed to its present name in 1854.
Christopher Southworth, 16 January 2008

From ""The Colours of the Fleet"" by Capt. Malcolm Farrow, page 2.14 (2008 ed.): 
""The familiar RNLI house flag is based on St George's cross. It was designed by Miss Leonora Preston in 1884, formally adopted in 1908, and has been painted on lifeboats since 1920. The RNLI currently operates about 280 named lifeboats in the UK and Ireland.""
Martin Grieve, 18 July 2009

The flag has a white field, whose proportions are three by two, bears the red cross of St George with a narrow dark blue border; the letters R.N.L.I. in red, are positioned one in the centre of each of the four white cantons. Centred upon the St George's Cross is the Royal Crown and a  foul anchor in yellow.
Martin Grieve, 18 July 2009

The first design of the RNLI flag was created by Leonora Preston in 1884 after her brother was rescued by Ramsgate lifeboat volunteers. The design depicts Saint George's Cross bordered by a dark blue line and within the white cantons, initials of the charity name coloured red. The first design included the Tudor crown worn by George VI at the centre of the cross with a foul anchor below it, representing the charity's dedication to the royal charter and to the sea. The design was formally adopted in 1908 and was flown at every lifeboat station thereafter.

The design of the flag has changed twice to reflect changing royal patronage. In 1953, following Elizabeth II's coronation, the design was altered to exchange the Tudor crown with St Edward's crown to represent the newly appointed monarch.[127][128] Following the accession of Charles III, the design re-adopted the Tudor crown.[129]

In 1964 the RNLI had a red ensign approved, which is flown from lifeboats.[130]",https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/g/gb~rnli2006.gif,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Lifeboat_Institution#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Royal_National_Lifeboat_Institution_(2024-).svg,Institution,1884,4,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, White",Red,"Blue, Red",(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-rnli.html,u/Geogrartist,-

1/7/2025 22:16:51,[IRE] Four Provinces Flag,"The Four Provinces Flag of Ireland. This flag, and variants of it, have been used by various all-Ireland sports teams and cultural organisations.

The arms of the four provinces of Ireland are shown in quadrants. The order in which the arms appear varies.

The four provinces
The four historical Irish provinces are not administrative divisions, and never were. Nowadays, though, they are sometimes used as convenient divisions of the country. From about the middle of the 17th century, coats of arms were attributed to the provinces. Flags representing the four provinces are now widely used, but there seems to be no evidence of their existence before the 20th century. There also exists the ""Four Provinces Flag"", which occasionally appears as a kind of substitute national flag. It consists of a flag composed of four quarters with the four provincial flags (clockwise, from upper hoist: Ulster, Munster, Connacht, Leinster). Source: Séamas Ó Brógáin: ""The Flags of the Four Provinces"" (I don't know where published: I only have a photocopy of the article).
Mario Fabretto, 21 August 1996

The Four Provinces flag has two main uses. Firstly, it is an economical way of flying the flags of all the provinces - one saves the cost of three flags and three flag poles! Secondly, it is sometimes flown when a politically neutral flag representing all of Ireland is required. For example, Irish hockey teams, which draw players from both the Republic and Northern Ireland, use the Four Provinces flag as their emblem in international competitions. As it is an unofficial flag, the order in which the provinces are represented is not fixed. The only constant seems to be that the two predominantly blue flags (Munster and Connacht) are always diagonally opposed.
Vincent Morley, 16 October 1996

With regards to the Four Provinces Flag, there are different orderings possible but the flag shown above is the most common arrangement (having the blue of Munster diagonally opposite that of Connacht). Going clockwise from the canton, the order follows the common spoken order when listing the provinces: Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht. Also, the image is much more accurate in terms of the shape of the crowns on Munster's quarter, the antique crown (also common in Irish heraldry). It's also worth noting that in Ireland, nearly all flags are seen in the 1:2 proportion including the provincial banners and county colors (in fact, I've never seen them any shorter in my travels there).
A note with regards to the three crowns of Munster. In one of the many stories about the emblem, the three crowns are said to represent the pre-Norman three kingdoms that made up the province of Munster, known as ""An Mhumhain"" or ""Cúige Mumhan"" in Irish and ""Momonia"" in Latin. The three kingdoms were Thomond (Tuaidh Mumhain, North Munster), Desmond (Deas Mumhain, South Munster), and Ormond (Oir Mumhain, East Munster). There was a fourth region, Iarmond (Iar Mumhain, West Munster) but this merged with Desmond and wasn't a distinct political entity.

For reference, the Irish names of the provinces are as follows (English, Irish short form, Irish ""Province of..."", Latin):
Ulster Ulaidh Cúige Uladh Ultonia
Munster An Mhumhain Cúige Mumhan Momonia
Leinster Laighin Cúige Laighean Lacenia
Connacht Connachta Cúige Chonnacht Connacia

1/7/2025 21:35:59,[IRE] GAA (Gaelic Athletics Association),"Ireland is unique in the world in that the regional 'county flags' originate directly
from sports. The sporting organisation responsible for the birth and use of
these county flags has been the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It was
founded in 1884 in Thurles, County Tipperary and since then has arguably been
the most important social, cultural and political movement on the island.
Flag of the Gaelic Athletic Association
(GAA)
Today the GAA is Ireland's largest sporting organisation; it 'is part of the Irish
consciousness and plays an influential role in Irish society that extends far
beyond the basic aim of promoting Gaelic games'. It is no surprise therefore
that it has had the greatest contribution in terms of symbolism and identity.
Indeed, many Irish flags and emblems either originate from the organisation or
have been strongly influenced by it.

1/7/2025 16:29:08,[YEM] Tihama,"Tihama is a coastal region extending from Hijaz to Hodaidah. Part of Tihama now belongs to Saudi Arabia (since the Taif Treaty), Prior to 1941, the region of Tihama was occupied by the Ottomans (twice), their ports were completely destroyed by the Italians during the Italian-Ottoman War and then controlled by the British. Parts of Tihama were ruled by the Idrissi Emirate, and then the Zaydi Imamate (under Imam Yehaya). The Tihamans track their first revolution to 1918 (against the corrupt Ottoman rule). Tihama has the majority of Yemen's valleys - including Wadi Moor which is the biggest in Yemen - and fisheries, as well as several farmlands. Between the area of Bora' and Al Sokhnah is a forest (3-5 km long) protected by UNESCO. Also, the region of Tihama is wealthy in historical artifacts, many of which are traced back to the Himyarite Kingdom.

The tribes of Tihama weakened significantly since 1920. Many of the people in Tihama practiced trade and embraced civilian life long ago. Since the early 1970s, the standards of living have not improved and the centralized government oppressed the people. Historically, Tihama had fertile farmlands, fisheries and valleys, yet they remain poverty-stricken. Some of the lands have parched due to the lack of management/ maintenance. Other fertile farmlands are managed and owned by powerful individuals outside of Tihama. Fisheries are monopolized by people in the former government and some who are still in the current government.

In February 2011 (Yemeni Revolution), the people of Tihama finally had the courage to speak up about their oppression. Tihaman Hirak is a massive movement that is not limited to a specific group and is open to all its directorates. They have thousands of members. A few individuals belonging to this movement call for armed resistance.

1/6/2025 16:25:50,[MIC] David O'Keefe (1880s-1901),"Description of the flag
David Dean O'Keefe (1824 or 1828 – 1901) was an Irish-American ship captain who become a historical and political figure on the island of Yap. O'Keefe turned himself ""King of Yap, Monarch of Mapia and Sovereign of Sonsoral"" but was in fact simply a prosperous trader. O'Keefe emigrated to the United States in 1848 and established himself in Savannah, Georgia. In 1871 he captained a ship to the South Pacific. After landing on Yap he became powerful by using tools from Hong Kong and East Asia to more easily create Rai (the famous stone money from Yap). In 1901 he died on the ship Santa Cruz returning to Savannah, probably because of a typhoon.
""His Majesty O'Keefe"" by Lawrence Klingman, and Gerald Green (1950) is the story of O'Keefe's life on Yap. A film of the same name starring Burt Lancaster (Director: Byron Haskin) was made in 1954.

According to Klingman and Green: O'Keefe initially flew the Confederate Stars and Bars as his national flag, but subsequently exchanged this for the Union Jack, and then for a personally-designed ensign - a green shamrock on a field of red, white and blue stripes over three green sprouting coconuts, a disc of white stone money, and the red letters, O.K. In the 1954 movie, a banner with the green shamrock is shown:

A complete article about the history of David O'Keefe can be read here: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/david-okeefe-the-king-of-hard-currency-37051930/ (article by Mike Dash published in smithsonianmag.com on July 28, 2011)

By the early 1880s, David O’Keefe was rich enough to build himself a red brick home on Tarang, an island in the middle of Yap’s harbor. Aside from a large library of all the most fashionable books—the captain enjoyed a reputation as an avid reader—he imported a piano, silver utensils and valuable antiques, and his property included four long warehouses, a dormitory for his employees, a wharf with moorings for four ships, and a store known as O’Keefe’s Canteen that sold the locals rum at 5 cents a measure. There were always plenty of people milling about: the canteen was run by a man named Johnny who was said to be a thief, a drunkard and a mechanical genius; Dolibu was waited on by two cooks and a houseboy; and there was also a Yapese loading crew paid “fifty cents a day plus some grub and drink.” And though Yap was, nominally, part of Spain’s overseas empire after 1885 (and German after 1898), O’Keefe flew his own flag over Tarang —the letters OK in black on a white background.
The source for the description of this flag is given here: http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/historical/frames/O'Keefefr.htm:
O'Keefe's headquarters on Terang was a showpiece of tropical elegance with a two-story red brick house, a spacious warehouse, living quarters for the workers, and a long stone wharf. Over the island, in place of the Union Jack that once flew there, was O'Keefe's own ensign - the initials OK in black on a white background
Source: Entry for 3 July, in John Rabe, Private Journals, Hawaiian and Pacific Collection, University of Hawai'i Library, Honolulu (hereinafter Rabe's journals); Hezel, The First Taint of Civilization, 266.

In 2014, the flag of O'Keefe was raised again for the first time. See: http://www.visityap.com/todo_news_okeefeflag.html:
Terang Island, Yap : O'Keefe's flag to be raised after 113 years ""His Majesty O'Keefe!"" That's how the author of a book on the trader David Dean O'Keefe entitled his biography. O'Keefe may not have been a king, nor even a chief, but he was a prosperous trader on Yap who helped make the island the trade center of the Western Carolines. He also had his own flag that he flew over his estate on Terang Island--at least until the Germans ordered him to take it down. O'Keefe's flag will fly over Terang once again, when O'Keefe's great granddaughter, Victorine O'Keefe Huevelman, raises the emblem--a large black OK on a field of white--on Friday, June 20 as part of Yap's annual Homecoming Day. The flag-raising, scheduled for 3 PM, is open to the public and boat transportation to Terang is available. The celebration of David Dean O'Keefe's legacy will be continued during the events of the Homecoming Day on Saturday, June 21

I've lived on Weno; there are several steep rises on the island which were used by various occupying military forces for lighthouses, lookouts, and weaponry. The image on the flag, which you describe as either a mountain or an octopus is actually both. On the island is a small ""mountain"" which is visible from Nepakos, the largest municipality. The natives call this mountain ""The octopus"" because of its shape and that the trees growing down the side look like tentacles. I've attached a picture here.

The Stoke Mandeville Games, first held in 1948 and continues today as the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports World Games, were the forerunner of the Paralympic Games.
The flag of the Stoke Mandeville Games was in the form of green-red-green horizontal stripes, with stylized white initials 'SMG' at the centre, surrounded by five-pointed white stars, the number of which varied over time, presumably to reflect the number of participating nations.
Miles Li, 31 August 2012

Do we have a source for the colour of the stars? At http://thepeacemuseumuk.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/9-paralympic-games/ is a photograph of an SMG cloth that may or may not be a flag, but which has the stars in a colour different from that of the letters. Click for a large image. And I do mean large! I enclose a cropped and scaled version of the design. How great was the variation in stars, BTW; so far I've only seen six stars. SMG cloth, hoisted along its top edge.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 08 January 2013

A colour photo from 1953 showed the stars were indeed white.  As seen on the abovementioned photo, the 1953 games flag had six stars. The 1954 games had 14 participating nations, and accordingly the flag had 14 stars: http://www.flickr.com/photos/wheelappeal/6985510929/in/photostream/
But there's more. The version used in the 1963 games had no star; instead a globe was placed at the centre, and the letters 'SMG' at its sides and bottom:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/wheelappeal/6985497243/in/photostream/
All the previous versions were shown held up as banners, thus arguably not 'real' flags, but an undated photo here showed yet another version flown on a proper flagpole. It was the same as the version used in 1963, but with three interlocking wheelchair wheels (one above two) in the canton:

Note that the globe was probably in full colours, and the wheels were in white, as per the 1964 games brochure:

IWAS World Games
""The International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports (IWAS) World Games (or IWAS World Games) are a multi-sport competition for athletes with a disability, which under the former name of the International Stoke Mandeville Games were the forerunner of the Paralympic Games. The competition has been formerly known as the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games, the Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, the Stoke Mandeville Games, the World Wheelchair Games, and in the 1960s and 1970s was often referred to as the Wheelchair Olympics.

The first edition of the Games, held in 1948 in London, were to be known as ""Stoke Mandeville Games for the Paralyzed"" or ""1948 Wheelchair Games"" because its first participants were on wheelchairs, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Summer Olympics. Hence, the games were known colloquially as the ""Wheelchair Games"". It has since then, been an event held on an annual basis. From 1949 until 1951 they were called ""Stoke Mandeville Games"" and for the 1952 edition, when Dutch ex-servicemen joined, it was called the ""1st International Stoke Mandeville Games"". From then on, up until 1960, the ""9th International Stoke Mandeville Games"" (later known as the 1st Paralympic Games) were held for the first time outside the UK, this time, in Rome, Italy, parallel to the 1960 Summer Olympics. From here onwards, it was decided that every four years another Paralympic Games would take place, to coincide with the Summer Olympic calendar, although the same venue would not be used up until 1988, when both editions, the Seoul 1988 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Summer Paralympics, were held in Seoul, South Korea.

From 1960 up to and including 1972, the Paralympic Games were organized solely under the aegis of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation, ISMGF (later International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation, ISMWSF and currently the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports, IWAS) and the Presidency of their Founder, Professor Sir Ludwig Guttmann. They concerned only spinal cord paralysed wheelchair athletes at the beginning, which eventually grew to encompass other disability groups.

The first time that a separate event was held, that is the Stoke Mandeville Games on one side and the Paralympics on the other, was in 1976, when the ""5th Summer Paralympics"" took place in Toronto, Canada, having also for the first time athletes with different disabilities and not exclusively on wheelchairs. This year also marked the 1st Winter Paralympic Games, held in Örnsköldsvik, Aangermanland, Sweden. It was also the the first time. The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their Summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were.

There's a variant of the already reported Stoke Mandeville Games flag. It is a horizontal flag, with three equally divided horizontal stripes, the top and bottom being red and the middle stripe being green, with a globe in the middle surrounded by a wheel of a wheelchair, and the initials ""S"" to the left of the globe, and ""M"" to the right, both on the middle stripe, and below the initial ""G"", all in white capitals, standing for Stoke Mandeville Games, as seen here (https://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/styles/mainpicture_612/public/images/20150303/150303125309785_Payne_0007.jpg?itok=kUGmSbi_ , source: https://www.paralympic.org/medals ) and here: https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/the-various-international-teams-during-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-picture-id149678345

The picture caption reads: ""The various international teams during the opening ceremony of the Summer Paralympic Games in Tokyo, 3rd November 1964."" This was first mentioned by Miles Li, on January 8, 2013, indicating that previous to the 1964 Games, the SMG banners were held up, thus arguably not 'real' flags and that the first real flag was then flown (with almost the same design as previous banners) in 1964. I have not found any sources that indicate when the first SMG flag was flown, nor when did it change from the first version with white stars, to the second version without stars.

1/5/2025 20:31:48,[.] International Paralympic Committee (1988-1991),"At the 1988 Summer Paralympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, Tae-Geuks were used in the logo for sports for athletes with a disability for the first time. This logo consisted of five Tae-Geuks which were similar, in colour and configuration, to the Olympic Rings. At the end of these Games the logo was adopted by the International Coordinating Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled (ICC). When the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was created in 1989, the new committee also adopted the five Tae-Geuks as its symbol.
In 1991 the IPC changed its logo at the request of the IOC, which felt the similarity of their logos was confusing and might hamper marketing. Thus the IPC eventually decided on a symbol of three Tae-Geuks, representing the Paralympic Motto: Mind, Body, and Spirit. However, since the Lillehammer Paralympic Organizing Committee (LPOC) had by then already started a marketing program for the 1994 Paralympic Winter Games based on the old logo, the new logo wasn't officially launched until after Lillehammer 1994 at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Berlin that same year.

New identity for the IPC
April, 2003. At its meeting in Athens on 5 April 2003, the IPC Executive Committee decided on a new corporate identity for the IPC. Working with the internationally renowned agency Scholz & Friends and many of the IPC stakeholders, a new look for the organisation was created, centred on the new direction of the IPC.

The new Paralympic logo consists of three elements in red, blue and greenâ€”the three colours that are most widely represented in national flags around the world. The shape of the three elements symbolises the new vision of the IPC ""To Enable Paralympic Athletes to Achieve Sporting Excellence and to Inspire and Excite the World"". The universality of the Paralympic Movement is shown through the round shape of the entire logoâ€”symbolising the globe.

""Spirit in Motion"" is the new Paralympic motto, expressing the inspirational character of the Paralympic Movement as well as elite performance of Paralympic athletes. It also stands for the strong will of every Paralympian. The word ""Spirit"" is derived from the notion that the IPC, like the athletes it represents, has a drive to compete and to succeed. But the IPC not only stages high performance sporting events, the strong message of the Movement accompanies it: the Paralympic Spirit. ""Motion"" relates to the idea that the IPC is truly moving forwardâ€”an organisation that realises its potential and is now striving to achieve it. Motion is ever present in the Movement, be it through athletes setting new records or the never-ending enthusiasm of volunteers and staff. Also, the Paralympian will have a new look in the future. The IPC is starting to use the new logo in all new publications and other products, and is looking forward to finalising this process by the ATHENS 2004 Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony.When handing over the flag to Beijing, a flag with the new logo will be used. The transition will be completed and from that day on, the old logo will no longer be used.

This new Paralympic look will also be seen in the logos of National Paralympic Committees and future organising committees of Paralympic Games. However, due to the limited time before the ATHENS 2004 Paralympic Games, ATHENS 2004 and participating delegations will continue using the three tae-geuks, which have stood for the mind, body and spirit of Paralympic athletes and the long way the IPC has come in the first 14 years of its existence.

Natalia provided a 1 MB image of the central part of the logo, so I amended our previous flag image removing the IPC (and the black edge) and updated the colours to those on the logo provided.
Rob Raeside, 23 April 2014

I followed this up with a message to Natalia Dannenberg-Spreier, who is  the IPC's Digital Media Manager, to determine whether the change merely consisted of removing the letters or whether the position of the other parts had changed because of that. And I asked whether she could help with an introduction date and with the reverse of the flag. Today I received the following explanations:

Natalia Dannenberg-Spreier wrote:
""The London 2012 Games were the first time that the Paralympic logo did not include the letters ""IPC"". The removal of the letters was the only change. On the reverse side of the [flag] you see the image reversed too.""

Based on this, I modified Juan Manuel Gabino Villascán's construction sheet which was based on International Paralympic Committee Standards Manual, to a version without the lettering. (In the process I also created a version without decimals, as usually we pick the values not to need decimals.)

1/5/2025 17:16:29,[CAN] Whitehorse,"Whitehorse
Originally a First Nation campsite, Whitehorse was named after the rapids south of the city which were said to resemble the manes of charging white horses.

In 1897, the difficulty of traversing the White Horse Rapids in Miles Canyon led to the creation of a horse-drawn tramway serving those on their way to the Klondike to seek gold. This became known as Canyon City.

White Horse became a major transportation hub and in 1942 was a focal point when the U.S. Army constructed the Alaska Highway. White Horse continued to be a transportation and communication hub afterwards, being incorporated as a city in 1950. In 1953, the capital of the Yukon was transferred from Dawson to White Horse and on March 21, 1957 the name was changed by the Geographic Board of Canada to Whitehorse.

The seal consists of a central disc surrounded by a golden-yellow band, edged on the outside by a ring of white rope with black details, and on the inside by a black ring. On the band appears THE CITY OF over the top, WHITEHORSE around the bottom, and between these at the mid-points 19 on the left and 50 on the right, oriented horizontally, all in black serif letters. The central disc is divided horizontally just below its mid-point by a black line. The resulting panels both depict naturalistic scenes. The upper panel has a landscape of green trees, above them are white mountains against a light blue sky. At the left is an approaching train in white, while on the right is a black auto road with a white centre stripe. The road curves to the left and bears a white car. An airplane in black and golden yellow flies toward the hoist, above the mountains. Surmounting the centre, one-third the diameter of the disc, is a half-disc in black bearing a horse’s head in white with black details, facing right. The lower panel has a lake scene with sky and water in light blue, along the horizon rolling green hills with trees in black, and a black and white paddleboat on the lake steaming toward the fly.

Symbolism
The white horse refers to the city’s name. During the Klondike Gold Rush, stampeders going to Dawson City travelled along the Yukon River and would pass by the white-capped rapids near Miles Canyon. The waves reminded them of the manes of galloping white horses. Whitehorse was the final stop for the White Pass & Yukon Route narrow-gauge railway. Built in the early 1900s, it conveyed miners and equipment to the gold fields. The train commemorates the importance the railway had to the economic development of the city. The steam paddleboat reflects the importance of river transportation in the early days of Whitehorse. At one time over 250 steam paddleboats plied the Yukon River between Whitehorse and the gold fields of Dawson and Mayo. The airplane honours the bush pilots who helped open up the North and provided a vital link to the outside world. The auto road represents the famed Alaska Highway, built by the United States Army during World War II to supply troops in Alaska. Today it continues to bring goods and tourists to Whitehorse. The mountains and forests in the background recall the area around the city. Whitehorse incorporated as a city in 1950.

1/4/2025 21:14:13,[IRE] Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (1986-1994),"In 1986, the county of Dublin was divided into three ""electoral counties"": Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin-Fingal, and Dublin-Belgard. In 1994, Dublin County Council and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire were abolished and the three electoral counties became administrative counties: Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin. In 2001, the administrative counties were redesignated as simply counties. The three counties together with Dublin city constitute the Dublin Region. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County is located between the outer suburbs of Dublin City and the Dublin/Wicklow Mountains on the East Coast of Ireland. It has a population of about 207,000 people.

We show below the ""Mountains to the Sea"" flag design concept by Andrew Gerard Ball, created in 2013. According to Michael Merrigan, County Councillor from May 2009 to May 2014 and from May 2014 to May 2019, and Co-founder of Vexillology Ireland, on his page about his activity in the county council before 2014:

1/4/2025 21:06:34,[IRE] Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (Mountains to the Sea flag),"The unofficial flag of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council was adopted in August 2014. It was originally designed and used for Bratacha 2013 – Ireland's first ever 'Festival of Flags and Emblems'.[12] The design concept was based on a combination of the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council emblem, the coat of arms and on a loose translation of the County motto: Ó Chuan go Sliabh, meaning ‘from harbour to mountain’. Today the flag flies every weekend at the County Hall in the town of Dún Laoghaire.

The unofficial flag of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council has a yellow field and features a green shamrock with two strokes – green and blue. The green stroke represents the mountains, while the blue one stands for the sea. This reflects the fact that the county is bordered by the Irish Sea and the Wicklow Mountains.

""Mountains to the Sea"" flag design concept by Andrew Gerard Ball with project artwork and graphics by Frank Lee Cooper - May 2013.

The flag design is taken from the County motto ""Ó Chuan go Sliabh"" which has been loosely translated as ""from the Mountains to the Sea"" and depicts a stylised mountain by the sea with the shamrock taken from the 1994 coat-of-arms of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.

The design brief was that the flag should be ""significant, distinctive and contemporary"" and be ""easily recognisable and identifiable"" when flying is a high wind or not.

The design concept by Australian born and long-time Dún Laoghaire resident, Andrew Gerard Ball, was based on the current logo of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and with the shamrock taken from the coat-of-arms of the County Council joining the traditional heraldic design with the modern logo. The addition of the shamrock (or trefoil) from the coat-of-arms provides the design with a major signifier of 'Ireland' and of Irish heritage, the flag is a beautiful modern and distinctive representation of entire County of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown - from the Mountains to the Sea.

Frank Lee Cooper from Dún Laoghaire provided the professional artwork and graphics for the project which brought the original design concept vividly to life as shown in the attached photographs.

The flag was crafted in cloth by the bespoke Dublin flag-makers, O'Regan's of Pearse Street, and was presented by An Tánaiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister), Éamon Gilmore, TD, to Special Guest, Mr. Graham Bartram, FFI, MGSI, of The Flag Institute in the UK, to mark the opening ceremony for Bratacha 2013 - Festival of Flags & Emblems at the unveiling of ""Europe in Bloom"" in Cabinteely Park on Thursday May 9th 2013.

Even today, the fish and the bird should not be caught or injured by anyone with blood relations to the people of this state as it is believed that doing so will result in disastrous consequences.

The circle in the center of the flag is 'O', the first letter of the old name of Ngardmau, Ongedechuul.
The picture of the water flowing inside the circle represents the Ngardmau waterfall. It is the tallest waterfall of Palau and it is one of the contributing sources of revenue to Ngardmau.
The picture of the mountain inside the circle depicts or represents the tallest mountain of Palau, which is in Ngardmau. This mountain is called Ngerchelchuus.
The coconut inside the circle shows that coconuts are one of the major sources of revenue in Ngardmau. It also indicates that Ngardmau has the most coconut of all Palau.
The bird is the frigate bird. The color of the bird is white which symbolizes the peaceful state of the village from the ancient to the present time.
The seven red stripes in the flag indicate that Ngardmau was conquered seven times.
The seven yellow stripes in the flag represent the seven pieces of Palauan money that were given to the conquerors so that Ngardmau could be restored to its peaceful lifestyle.
The three stars in the flag represent the three villages that are inhabited today. The three villages are Ngetbong, Ngerutoi, and Urdmau. If other villages will be inhabited in the future, additional stars will be placed between the three stars to correspond to the number of villages that will be inhabited.

1/4/2025 2:37:17,[USA] Montpelier (Vermont),"Description of the flag
From Seven Days:
Vermont's Capital City Gets a New Flag, Because Why Not?
This evening, Montpelier City Councilor Anne Watson and City Clerk John Odum unveiled the state capital's new flag during the annual July 3rd celebrations.
The minimalist winning design, by East Montpelier native Chet Larrow, features rolling green hills topped by a navy-blue sky. Centered in the blue field is a circle of 14 golden stars. Larrow is an industrial designer for Key Technologies in Baltimore, Md.
In a press release issued earlier today, Larrow is quoted as saying his entry ""emphasizes Montpelier's representation of the 14 counties as well as [Vermont] being the 14th state to join the union. The gold stars are displayed in a circle to subtly represent the iconic round dome that both visitors and locals come to associate the city with.""
Larrow's design was one of three finalists, chosen from about 60 submissions, said Odum.
The new flag is a replacement for a hasty design implemented in 2001 to satisfy a request for a city flag to be used in California's Rose Parade. Up until that point, Montpelier didn't have one.
The banner will be formally adopted on Wednesday, July 12, at the next city council meeting, then will be raised in front of city hall to proudly wave.

Smyrna is a town in Kent county in the State of Delaware. Town has population of 10,092 in 2008: www.smyrna.delaware.gov/index.aspx?nid=144.
Valentin Poposki, 29 August 2009

The flag of Smyrna is white with the new town seal and can be seen on Google Maps. It was adopted anywhere between 2019 and 2022, the years in which the town hall can be seen on Google Maps. It is believed that the former flag was replaced due to the adoption of the new seal.

1/2/2025 21:40:10,[USA] Harrington (Deleware),"The flag of Harrington was adopted on February 19, 2019 as seen in the council meeting minutes. No standardization of the flag is laid out, though City Manager Donald Williams (who can probably be considered the designer) is the person who proposed the idea of a new city flag; this is since the city flag supply was running low and the city had adopted its new seal and slogan recently before that.

The flag can also be seen on Google Maps. The flag consists of a blue field, with a white circle centered upon it. Within the circle is a locomotive facing away from the hoist, the locomotive clearly being a symbol of Harrington's past. Below the white circle is the town's slogan, Where Delaware Comes Together, which is clearly a reference to the state fair which is held in Harrington every July. It is not clear if there is text above the white circle; if there is it most likely reads City of Harrington or something similar. This flag is flown on flagpoles outside; a variant using the city’s seal is used inside the city hall.

The county flag has a white field and in the middle the Kent County seal. The seal shows the Coat of Arms of William Penn
on a white circular background. In 2008, the seal was modified. The silver coat of arms of William Penn is now on a blue circle and the ring with the motto is now yellow.

1/1/2025 20:14:50,[DRC] [BEL] International Congo Society (1877 - 1885),"When the Congo Free State was formed in 1885, its flag, reputedly designed by the explorer H.M. Stanley, was blue with a gold star in the centre. One explanation of its symbolism was the light of civilization (i.e., the star) shining in the darkness of Africa.  No change was made to the flag when the Free State became Belgian territory in 1908.
Stuart Notholt, 10 Mar 1996
I am writing on the flag used by the Congo Free State. According to J Roland and E Duchesne, Cours Complet de Geographie, Le Congo Belge, Namur 1914, p.9; the Congolese flag had been hoisted since 1877 by the Association Internationale Africaine (presided by King Leopold of Belgium) founded at the Brussels Geographic Conference (1876).
Alexander Ganse, 19 Oct 2000

The Roland/Duchesne booklet states:

""Two months after the closing of the conference [that is: April 1885], Leopold II requested, conforming with the Belgian constitution, and obtained from the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate the authorization to become the Sovereign of the Independent State of the Congo. One of the first acts of the new state was to declare itself perpetually neutral. It adopted a blue flag with a golden star in it's center, which the International African Association had hoisted since 1877.""

It appears from those pages that Stanley was very busy traveling, exploring and civilizing and that he had hardly time to do some flag-designing. And I haven't found the reference to the mysterious African prince.
Jarig Bakker, 05 Feb 2001

At http://digilander.libero.it/breschirob/congofig.jpg  (as an illustration in Berschi's site at http://digilander.libero.it/breschirob/aggiorna.html), are shown some pre-independence symbols of Belgian Congo: flag, Coat of Arms and traditional costume (?).

The flag is the well known big yellow star on blue and the Coat of Arms is (a shield with parallel sides and triangle tip) azure a fess argent, overall on an escutcheon Sable a lion rampant Or.

The said escutcheon shows the same armorial bearings as in Belgian royal flags, which is consistent with Belgian Congo's official status: not a colony of Belgium but the personal property of the Belgian King.

The blue background with a white stripe may be influenced by the (pre-existing?) blue flag with the stripe standing either for the equator line which crosses the territory or for the eponymous river Congo/Zaire.

Either way, this design (blue background with a white horizontal stripe) may have been the basis for the basic design of (the successive versions of) the
municipal flag of Kinshasa (former Leopoldville).
António Martins-Tuválkin, 05 Sept 2006

I have been reading Thomas Pakenham's ""The Scramble for Africa"" (London: Abacus, 1992) which includes the following interesting reference:
Chapter 14, p. 243 : In 1884 King Leopold of Belgium was looking for international recognition for the newly invented flag of the International Association of the Congo. Pakenham adds that the design of a blue flag with a gold star was ""borrowed from the old kingdom of Congo in Angola"", a fact that is not mentioned in any of your articles.

Unfortunately, although the book is footnoted, this reference is not.

1/1/2025 20:02:42,[DRC] Zaire (1971 - 1997),"Description
The Constitution of Zaire, which was in force until last Saturday was adopted 05 July 1990. The flag was described in article 4 of Title 1 (The Territory and sovereignty of the Republic) as follows:
Article 4: The emblem of the Republic is a light green flag, ornamented in the centre with a yellow circle in which a right hand is holding a torch with a red flame.
This flag was adopted on 19th November 1971 when the parliament adopted Loi no. 71-007 du 19 novembre 1971 portant revision de la Constitution.
In the first week of August 1992 there was already a legal move to get rid of the ’green flag with torch’. At that time a National Conference was held in Kinshasa, which task it was to give Zaire a new, democratic constitution. This National Conference decided to rename Zaire back to Congo as well as to go back to ""the old flag"". Already a few days later this National Conference was abolished by order of  President Mobutu.
Jos Poels, 19 May 97

As far as I know the lightest green used on a flag was in Zaire’s flag.
Ralf Stelter, 25 Jul 1999

I saw sizes ranging from 1 to 1 proportionally to1 to2.
Some flags had apple green backgrounds, Irish green backgrounds, dark green backgrounds. Some had red flames, orange flames, yellow flames outlined in black. I saw orange arms, brown arms, black arms, black torches, brown torches, badges so big they occupied almost the whole of the flag, badges so small there was no point defacing the flag to begin with, and it goes on and on. I reckon a third of the flags I saw had the arm and torch facing toward the fly.

All of the above mentioned flags were flying over government facilities.
Clay Moss, 17 May 2005

In Flags through the ages and across the world, Smith (1975) [smi80] notes that the original proposal for a new Zaire flag displayed a narrow red horizontal stripe above the central yellow disc, recalling the blood of national martyrs. A corresponding stripe below the disc was blue, to symbolize the rivers and lakes of the country. The stripes were omitted in the final design, which bore a modification of the emblem of the Popular Movement of the Revolution. The flag incorporated the Pan African colours of red, yellow and green. Green is a symbol of hope, faith in the future and confidence of the people. Unity is symbolized by a disc, whose yellow colour stands for Zaire’s extensive natural resources. The arm bearing a flaming torch graphically expressed the revolutionary spirit the nation aspired to; its red flames an honour to the nation’s martyrs.

The design is a combination of the flag of Norway and the Dublin county colours, thus reflecting both Norse and Gaelic aspects of Dublin's history. The design is created by repainting the field of Norwegian flag into sky blue and the cross into navy blue; the border of the cross remains white.

1/1/2025 19:22:00,[BOS] Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (1991-1994),"Presentation of Herzeg-Bosnia
Herzeg-Bosnia was the name of a Croat ""entity"" within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first half of the 1990s.
Immediately before the beginning of armed conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as response to ever more separatist and aggressive policies of forming Serb state units, political units were formed in late 1991 to enable the defense of the territory. In the northeastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina were formed on 12 November 1991 the Croatian Community of Bosnian Posavina, encompassing eight communities with the seat in Bosanski Brod, and on 18 November 1991 in the southwestenr parts of the state the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia, encompassing 30 communities with the seat in Mostar. The Croatian Community of Usora was formed on 14 January 1992 in Usora and Teslić, while the Croatian Community of Central Bosnia was formed on 27 January 1992 in Žepče.
The four communities, and another two that were not fully functional, formed in Tuzla (Soli) and in Sarajevo (Vrhbosna), were unified on 8 April 1992 with the formation of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) as the highest executive and government body, and became the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia.

Initially HVO fought together with the Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks, as they were soon known), eventually the conflict arouse between the two parties, as well. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina delared the formation of Herzeg-Bosnia unconstitutional, to no avail. In the escalation of the war in 1993, Herzeg-Bosnia lost some parts of its initial territory. Following the Owen-Stoltenberg Plan of reorganization of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the union of three republics, the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia was established on 28 August 1993.
Herzeg-Bosnia was merged on 18 March 1994 with the Bosniak state by the WashingtonAgreement, forming the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, it was not formally disbanded until 14 August 1996 and partially functioned in the transition of power to federal bodies until the end of 1996.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled in 2001 that Herzeg-Bosnia had been founded with the intention to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Croatia; however, no such proclamation was ever made and Herzeg-Bosnia documents all put the name of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina above in the header, maintaining the position that Herzeg-Bosnia was ""simply"" an organizational form of defense of Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Željko Heimer, 23 July 2016

Flag of Herzeg-Bosnia
The flag and arms of Herzeg-Bosnia are prescribed by Regulation (Decree) Uredba o grbu i zastavi Hrvatske Zajednice Herceg-Bosna, adopted on 18 November 1992 by the Government of Herzeg-Bosnia (HVO), signed on the same day by Dr. Jadranko Prlić, chairman of the HVO, and published in the official gazette of Herzeg-Bosnia, No. 7.

The flag is described in Article 10 as follows:

The flag of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia is composed of three colours: red, white, and blue, with the coat of arms of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia in the centre. The ratio of width to length of the flag is 1:2. The flag colours are set horizontally in this order from the top: red, white and blue. Each colour forms a third of the flag width. The coat of arms of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia is set in the centre of the flag so that the top part of the coat of arms (the triple wattle) enters the red field of the flag, and thebottom part of the coat of arms (in height one square field) enters the blue field of the flag. The central point of the coat of arms matches the crossing point of the flag's diagonals.
Article 11 of the Regulation prescribes the modes of use of the flag. Paragrahh 5 specifies that the flag shall be hoisted by ships and other vessels in maritime and inland navigation.

1/1/2025 18:29:38,[BOS] Canton 10,"Presentation of Canton 10
Canton 10 is located along the western border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its original name, Herzeg-Bosnia Canton, was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Presuda Ustavnog suda Federacije BiH, adopted on 20 November 1997 and 19 February 1998, and published on 17 June 1998 in the Federation official gazette Službene novine Federacije BiH, No. 24). The name was not accepted since no part of the Canton includes any territory of Herzegovina, while the Federal Contitution requests that cantons be named after the towns of their seats of government or regions they cover. Terefore, the canton is officially named simply as Canton 10.

Željko Heimer, 14 May 2000

Flag of Canton 10
The symbols of Canton 10 are prescribed in Articles 8 and 9 of the Canton Constitution Ustav Hercegbosanske Županije, adopted on 26 March 1996 by the Canton Assembly and published on 10 April 1996 in the Canton official gazette Narodne novine Hercegbosanske županije, No. 3.

The flag is a red over white over blue tricolour, in proportions 1:2. The coat of arms is set in the middle, so that the wattle enters the red stripe and the base of the shield enters the blue stripe. The height of the shield is not proscribed, but based on the prescription that the center is in the middle of the flag, and that the ""depth"" of the shield in the blue field is one height of the squares in the shield, it is clear that it is just about 1/2 of the hoist.
The flag is equal to the flag adopted in 1992 by the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia

The symbols were invalidated in the same ruling of the Constitutional Court invalidating the name of the canton. They do not represent the two ethnical communities, but only and exclusivly the Croats. From the day of publication of the ruling in the official gazette, the symbols were not official any more, but they have remained in de facto use ever since. The cantonal government deemed the self-ruling of the Contitutional Court unconstitutional and refused to obey it. This claim is supported by the ""personal opinion"" of one of the judges of the Constitutional Court, published in the same official gazette right after the ruling, stating, basically, that the symbols are not unconstitutional, since the Consitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has no provision regarding the design of symbols. They were, supposedly, adopted by a regular procedure and thus quite valid. The judge understands that some people of the canton can object to the design, but the procedure for the change or invalidation of those symbols should be made by other means and not through the Constitutional Court.

The Canton has a coat of arms, a flag and a seal.
The design of the coat of arms, the flag and the seal of the Canton, their use and protection are determined with the Cantonal law.
The Canton may have also other symbols on which the Cantonal Assembly decides.
The flag is basically a variant of the Croatian national flag, from which it differs only by the coat of arms. It was described in the revoked Article 9 of the cantonal Consitution as follows:

The flag of the Canton is composed of three colours: red, white and blue, with the coat of arms of the Canton in the middle.
The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 1:2. The colours are set horizontally, from the top to bottom: red, white and blue. Each colour covers one third of the flag width.
The coat of arms of the Canton is set in the middle of the flag so that the top part of the coat of arms (triple wattle) enters the red field of the flag, and the bottom part of the coat of arms (in the height of one square field) enters the blue field of the flag.

The companion Law Zakon o uporabi grba i zastave Hercegovačko-neretvanske županije-kantona, adopted the same day and published in the same issue of the gazette, prescribes the rules of use of the symbols.

The flag is described in Article 3 of the Law as follows:

The flag of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton is rectangular in shape with five horizontally arranged, proportional fields of equal size, from top to bottom: red, white, blue, white, and red. In the middle of the flag is the coat of arms of the Herzegovina-Newretva Canton as determined in Article 2 of this Law. The coat of arms is set so that it begins and ends in the middle of the white fields. The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 3:5.
The red, white and green stripes refer to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the Croat and Bosniak majorities, while the blue stripe in the middle represents river Neretva.

The flag, in proportions 3:5, is horizontally divided green-white with the coat of arms in the middle.
The coat of arms is obviously based on the previous coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the well known fleur-de-lis coat of arms. The golden ornament in the white bend is, I guess, nothing more than an ornament, though it might be based on the representation of the historical fleur-de-lis arms in some of the famous armorials. The three flowers in the lower part are, I guess, again from some historical source, the lilies made more naturally. The helmet issuing from the bend might be from the same period (12th century?).

The outcome of the public debate was published on 12 December 2012 ( article). The officer of the Ministry of Administration is quoted, stating that the proposed amendments are simply ""a modification of the regulations adopted 13 years ago, while in the meantime the normative frame was modified at the higher levels, some constitutional changes were made etc., so that the amendments are just adjustments to those.""

Tuzla Canton was called Tuzla-Podrinje Canton (Tuzlansko-podrinjski kanton) until February 1999. Podrinje means ""region near river Drina"", but the river does not flow in the Canton, therefore the name change.

The symbols of Tuzla-Podrinje Canton were prescribed by Law Zakon o utvrđivanju i upotrebi grba i zastave Tuzlansko-podrinjskog kantona, adopted on 8 and 11 August 1996 by the Canton Assembly and published on 13 August 1996 in the Canton official gazette Službene novine Tuzlansko-podrinjskog kantona, No. 4 (text).

The Canton has a coat of arms, a flag and a seal, as well as other symbols, on which the Cantonal Assembly decides.
The symbols of the Canton shall be used next to the symbols of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance to the laws of the Federation.
For the adoption of the symbols the majority of votes in the Cantonal Assembly is required.
The flag is in proportions 1:2, horizontally divided green-white-red. The green stripe takes up top 70% of the flag width, the white and red 15% each. The coat of arms is set ""in the centre of the left side"".

The use of the symbols is prescribed by the companion Law Zakon o upotrebi grba i zastave Unsko-Sanskog Kantona, adopted the same day. The two Laws came into effect on 12 August 2007.
The two Laws were proclaimed by Decisions Odluka o proglašenju Zakona o grbu i zastavi Unsko-sanskog kantona and Odluka o proglašenju Zakona o upotrebi grba i zastave Unsko-sanskog kantona, respectively, adopted on 4 August 1997.
The four texts were published on 11 August 1997 in Službeni glasnik Unsko-sanskog kantona, No. 2 (text).

The flag is defined in Article 2 of the Law on the symbols. The colours are based on the colours of the coat of arms; the design might have been influenced by the flags used by Bosniaks during the recent war. The proportions of the flag are rather unusual, 1:1.75 (4:7), and the width of the stripes is 1:3:12:3:1. The height of the coat of arms is half the flag's hoist, and it is set in the middle of the flag.
The colours are prescribed as Golden SCC 2707, Blue SCC 47 and Green SCC 54. SCC is the proprietary colour system scale of the Slovenian company Cinkarna Celje; SCC 47 appears to match the standard CMYK Cyan.

The Law on the use of the symbols prescribed the vertically hoisted flag to be hoisted so that the green stripe comes on the right - whatever that actually means - and if it is taken to mean the most straightforward then it is against the usual vertical hoisting principle. There is no mention that the coat of arms should be rotated on such a flag, which probably is not intended. The vertical variant is therefore obtained by a simple rotation of the horizontal flag 90 degrees clockwise.
The Law prescribes this flag for use by the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is, it can be considered as a war flag, too. There is also a legal prescription that allows the flag and the coat of arms to be included on military flags (unit, command and ranks and other flags).

In 1999, after the Decision of the Office of the High Representative on the ban of all non-neutral and offensive symbols, the symbols of Una-Sana Canton were invalidated. It seems that the Decision was respected both legally and practically, which did not really happened in some other cantons.

The colours of the flag are arranged horizontally, ordered so from the top: red, white and blue. Each of the colours takes one third of the width of the flag. The coat of arms of the Canton is set in the middle of the flag, and the lower end of the coat of arms (as high as one square field) enters into the blue field of the flag.

The coat of arms of the Posavina Canton is set in the middle of the flag. The central point of the coat of arms matches the point in which the diagonals of the flag intersect.""

The verso page of the gazette contains images of the symbols. In the image of the flag, the coat of arms is not set in the middle of the flag but is offset somewhat towards the top, though not in the middle of the red and white stripes together, either.
The red stripe represent Croats, while the green stripe represent Bosniaks.

12/31/2024 19:35:42,[BOS] Una-Sana Canton (Canton 1),"Flag of Una-Sana Canton
The symbols of Una-Sana Canton are prescribed by Law Zakon o grbu i zastavi Unsko-Sanskog Kantona, adopted on 9 May 2000. The Law was proclaimed by Decision Odluka o proglašenju Zakona o grbu i zastavi Unsko-sanskog kantona, adopted on 18 May 2000. The two texts were published on 7 June 2000 in the Canton official gazette Službeni glasnik Unsko-sanskog kantona, No. 3 (text).
The use of the symbols is prescribed by Law Zakon o upotrebi grba i zastave Unsko-Sanskog Kantona, adopted on 31 May 2000. The Law was proclaimed by Decision Odluka o proglašenju Zakona o grbu i zastavi Unsko-sanskog kantona, adopted on 4 August 2000. The two texts were published on 7 August 2000 in Službeni glasnik Unsko-sanskog kantona, No. 5 (text).
The two Laws superseded the Laws of the same name prescribing the former symbols of the Canton.

The symbols are prescribed in Article 7 of the consolidated text of the Constitution Ustav Unsko-sanskog kantona (prečišćeni tekst), adopted on 10 December 2003 and published on 15 January 2004 in Službeni glasnik Unsko-sanskog kantona, No. 1 (text):
""(3) The Canton symbols shall be used, with the symbols of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Federation in accordance with the Laws.""

The symbols were adopted following a contest held in December 1999.

The flag (Proposal ""B"") is in proportions 1:2, horizontally divided into three equal stripes blue over white over green. The coat of arms is set in it, offset towards the hoist for better visibility. The length from the hoist to the coat of arms' vertical axis is 3/5 of the hoist's size. The coat of arms is entering the blue and the green stripe for 1/3 of the width of each stripe, that is, the height of the shield is 5/9 of the flag's width.
The colours are prescribed as Blue SCC43, Green SCC 54, Yellow SCC 3 and Golden SCC 2708. SCC is the proprietary colour system scale of the Slovenian company Cinkarna Celje; SCC 3 appears to match the standard CMYK Yellow.

The two Laws are more or less adapted versions of the previous Laws; all the interesting details noticed about the previous flag are still valid. Accordingly, the flag is prescribed also as the war flag, and could be used as a basis for military unit colors, command and rank flags. When hoisted vertically, the blue stripe should be to the ""right"".

12/30/2024 13:41:25,[GER] German Democratic Republic (1959-1990),"While the use of black-red-gold had been suggested in the Soviet zone in 1946, the Second People's Congress in 1948 decided to adopt the old black-white-red tricolour as a national flag for East Germany. This choice was based on the use of these colours by the National Committee for a Free Germany, a German anti-Nazi organisation that operated in the Soviet Union in the last two years of the war. In 1949, following a suggestion from Friedrich Ebert Jr., the black-red-gold tricolour was instead selected as the flag of the German Democratic Republic upon the formation of this state on 7 October 1949. From 1949 to 1959, the flags of both West and East Germany were identical. On 1 October 1959, the East German government changed its flag with the addition of coat of arms. In West Germany, these changes were seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the two Germanies. Displaying this flag in West Germany and West Berlin—where it became known as the Spalterflagge (divider-flag)—was seen as a breach of the constitution and subsequently banned until the late 1960s.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Flag_of_East_Germany.svg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Flag_of_East_Germany.svg,Historical,1959,3,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Red, Yellow",Yellow,"Black, Red, Yellow",Black,Red,Yellow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_East_Germany,,Germany

In the final design for Navassa, the island is just one shade of emerald green with a white sky and a royal blue sea and the size of the lighthouse has been exaggerated and is a light gray with a green roof. People either liked this flag a lot or not at all. The actual 3x5 flag wasn't that bad. The flag is not official; it was designed to represent the island for December 7th as a tribute to those Americans who sacrificed and served during the Second World War.
Skip Wheeler, 25 December 2002

Navassa got its unofficial flag and was first hoisted on 7 December 2001. The flag was designed by Mr. Harry Wheeler in Hawaii and its ratio is 3 by 5. The flag depicts emerald green island with a light grey lighthouse under white sky and in blue ocean. On 7 December 2001 the flag was first hoisted together with Johnston, Palmyra unofficial flags at USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii under U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services for 60th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack by Imperial Japanese planes and the sunk battleship USS Arizona.

About Navassa Island
According to the CIA World Factbook:

Navassa Island - 5 sq. km., uninhabited - transient Haitian fishermen and others camp on the island; about one-fourth of the way from Haiti to Jamaica; strategic location 160 km south of the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; mostly exposed rock, but enough grassland to support goat herds; dense stands of fig-like trees, scattered cactus.
Jarig Bakker, 29 January 2000

Uninhabited since 1898 when the last phosphate miners left. Claimed by the Baltimore Fertilizer Company under the Guano Act.
Phil Nelson, 25 April 2000

A few years ago I read a ham radio magazine article about a DXpedition to Navassa Island, probably half a dozen years ago, which said that the U.S. government maintained a lighthouse on Navassa, and a lighthouse-keeper was stationed there until the light was automated, which I purely guess may have been between ten and twenty years ago. The expedition found a Haitian family living on Navassa (which Haiti also claims), eating fruit and fish.
John Ayer, 26 April 2000

An order by the Secretary of the Interior dated December 3, 1999, transferred jurisdiction over Navassa Island from the Bureau of Insular Affairs to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Joe McMillan, 12 June 2000

Haiti's claim to Navassa Island (called La Navase by Haiti) starts when Columbus discovered Hispaniola in 1493. Later in 1627, Hispaniola was split between the French and the Spanish. Navassa Island was included in the spilt. According to the Haitians, Navassa Island became a part of Haiti in 1804 and this fact was recognized by the French in 1825. The US claims that the Island was up for grabs until 1859, when Peter Duncan made a claim on the island under the Guano Islands Act. The US also claims that Haitian claim is invalid since Haiti never bothered to enforce tax laws on tine island. Haiti's claim remains unresolved.

There is a private claim on the island. Californian businessman Bill Warren expressed an interest in the island in 1996 intending to find treasure, but later found out about the Guano. He made a claim on the Island under the Guano Islands Act. Warren has brought Navassa Island from the heirs of the people who owned the island in the 1850's. He has even sued to have his claim enforced. He has been unsuccessful in his suits so far. In 1998, an environmental survey was done on the island and this could upset any claim that Warren has.

Wake Island - 7,8 sq. km. (with Wilkes and Peale), 302 inhabitants; unincorporated territory of the US administered by the US Army Missile and Strategic Defense Command since 1 October 1994.
Jarig Bakker, 29 January 2000
According to Ludvik Mucha's 1985 book The Orbis Encyclopedia of Flags and Coats of Arms (ed. by William Crampton), p. 195, Wake Island does have a flag of its own, albeit an unofficial one. It's horizontally white over red with a vertical blue stripe at the hoist.  The trailing edge of the blue stripe is not straight but forms a point where the white and red stripes meet. In the blue there is a yellow disk containing a map of the atoll in blue, with the words WAKE above and ISLAND below in blue. The disk is flanked by three yellow five-pointed stars, all with one point upwards, one above, one flywards and one below.  The badge is nearly right except the words should be a bit smaller, maybe 2/3, and the map more pronounced - the elements of the island should be thicker and oriented so that the ""arms"" are parallel with the top and bottom of the flag.
Roy Stilling, 5 and 21 October 1996

Wake Island was first discovered by the Spaniard Álvaro de Mendana in 1586, who named it San Francisco and claimed it in the name of the King of Spain. This claim was internationally recognized, the atoll being viewed as worthless. It was completely uninhabited, isolated, without fresh water, and very literally in the middle of nowhere. Wake remained a territory of Spain for the next three centuries. It lay undisturbed for the next 210 years, until in 1796 the Englishman Captain Samuel Wake of the merchant vessel Prince William Henry rediscovered it. He gave the atoll its present name, also carried by its largest island. ""Wake Island"" properly refers only to this island; the collection of three islands, the reef, and the lagoon are known as ""Wake Atoll.""

Soon after, another British ship stumbled across the island, unaware of Captain Wake's recent visit, but no other ships came that way for another 44 years. On December 20, 1840, the USS Vincennes brought the explorer Charles Wilkes and the naturalist Titian Peale to the island. They conducted a series of surveys and lent their names to the other two islands of the atoll.

Upon their departure, Wake again lay undisturbed for many years. On the night of March 5, 1866, the German ship Libelle, en route from Honolulu to Hong Kong, was caught in a mid-Pacific storm, blown far off course, and finally went ashore on the coral reef outlying the atoll. The few survivors managed to salvage two small boats (and $300,000) from the wreck of their ship. Making the boats seaworthy, they departed the island after three weeks in a desperate voyage for Guam and survival, 1400 miles distant. One boat reached Guam; the other vanished. A subsequent salvage expedition recovered the money.

During the Spanish-American War, an American troop convoy bound for the Philippines (then owned by Spain) stopped off at Wake. Major General Francis V. Greene hoisted the Stars and Stripes, then with 45 stars, there on July 4, 1898. The flag was actually tied to a dead tree limb. The subsequent peace treaty which ended the war transferred Wake to the United States. The US desired the island for a cable station, but these plans were dropped when it was realized that no fresh water was available. Until 1935, Wake continued much as before, although visits were more frequent. Captain John J. Pershing, subsequently General of the Armies, replaced the older flag with a larger, more durable canvas version, also 45-starred, in 1906. US surveying expeditions visited in 1922-23, presumably replacing Pershing's flag with 48-starred versions.

In 1935 Pan American Airways began construction of a seaplane facility on Wake, which provided a convenient point for servicing and refueling of the famous ""Pan Am Clippers"", four-engine flying boats which provided aerial transportation between Manila, Tokyo, and San Francisco. Wake became one of the stopping points on the Manila-San Francisco run (others included Midway and Honolulu.) The US Navy recognized the potential of Wake as a military base and contributed both materially and financially to the construction of the Pan Am facilities, which were completed in the fall of 1935.

In January 1941, as war with Japan loomed, the US Navy began construction of a military base on the atoll. As such, Wake would provide a vital American outpost in the Pacific. It was not until August 19, however, that the first permanent US military garrison arrived, elements of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion. When war did come, these men were the backbone of Wake's defenses. In a gallant struggle lasting over two weeks, the US flag was never lowered. (Although shot off its pole during the final battle, it was quickly replaced on a lookout tower.) Wake first repulsed a Japanese landing attempt (the only time in World War II that an amphibious assault was defeated), was besieged without resupply, and finally succumbed to a second Japanese landing on December 23. After that, Wake was a backwater of the Pacific War and was occasionally raided, but never attacked in force. On September 4, 1945, the surviving Japanese garrison (many had starved to death, no resupply being available) surrendered to elements of the US Marine Corps. In a brief ceremony, Master Technical Sergeant Ralph Broc and Private First Class Millard Moore raised the Stars and Stripes over Wake, replacing the Japanese flag flown there since December 1941. Subsequently the island was turned over to the administration of the US Navy. Eventually the island passed under the control of the US Air Force, which used it for various purposes during the Cold War, mostly related to strategic defense and operations. At present it is administered by the Army Missile and Strategic Defense Command, but its role has not significantly changed.

I recently contacted the Nature Conservancy (the new caretakers of Palmyra Atoll) to see if they would consider making [the flag used by U.S. sailors during World War II] the unofficial flag of the atoll--giving some respect to the men who gave up so much for our freedom and who left the atoll slightly changed but pretty much the way it is today.

I received a letter from the regional director of the Nature Conservancy. She gave me permission to use the extinct Palmyra flag for our state and territorial flag display at the USS Arizona Memorial on December 7, 2001, the 60th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack. Palmyra has agreed to fly the ""GI flag"" on an unofficial basis.

The Palmyra design was slightly altered to meet reality. The original design and color were pretty much kept; however the red sky was enlarged and the yellow beach was reduced. The sun was ""lifted"" out of the water. The Nature Conservancy has no intention of making this flag the official banner for the territory, but they allowed us to manufacture it for the December 7th exercises.

These were not featured in previous N.A.V.A publications. The first design is of a then current Palmyra Atoll flag with the addition of an outline of Palmyra Atoll on the central blue stripe. The atoll is in green and the lagoon that surrounds is in light blue. The second design again the current Palmyra Atoll flag but this time incorporating a native boobie bird sitting atop a branch silhouetted by the rising / setting sun. The branch in brown is centred on the central blue strip with green leaves radiating off a bend toward the fly of the flag and a trunk jutting down to the bottom of the flag.

Reconstructed World War II Flag of Palmyra Atoll
[Reconstructed World War II Flag of Palmyra Atoll] image by Andy Weir

My grandfather was stationed on Palmyra during World War II and I have a black and white picture of him and a few of his buddies in front of the flagpole. On top is the 48-star US flag, and under that is a flag I didn't recognize. I asked my grandfather, and he said it was not a naval flag or the flag of his unit. Our conclusion is that it must be the flag of Palmyra, probably invented by the sailors there at the time. My grandfather remembers the colors, and there is no coat of arms or anything on it. It is just a collection of shapes. As far as I can tell from the picture and a ruler, it is a 2:3 flag. I can't be sure of that, because it is not being fully wind-blown in the picture. I also cannot guarantee that the flag I make will be perfectly accurate. There are parts of it I can't see, but it's mostly bars anyway, with one half-circle (representing a ""flat"" Japanese dot according to my grandfather, but he's prone to exaggeration). I took some liberties with the colors, because I was working with a black and white photo. My grandfather says it looked like a sunset (or sunrise) as seen from the beach at Palmyra, and claims to remember the colors. The red bar on top is the sunrise (or sunset) sky. The blue bar in the middle is the ocean, and the yellow bar on the bottom is the beach. The ""beach"" was more idealistic than anything else, because Palmyra doesn't have much beach. The foliage mostly goes almost to the water. The yellow half-circle to me obviously represents the sun, but my grandfather says it is a ""deflating Japanese dot."" If that were the case, why not make the semi-circle red? You'd have to pick a new color for the ""sky,"" I suppose. Anyway, I disagree with my grandfather's assessment.

So, there you have it. The unofficial, probably extinct, made up by sailors, flew over the island for a couple of years only, not recognized by any authority, flag of Palmyra.

The Nature Conservancy site states: before agreeing to sell the atoll to the Conservancy, the Fullard-Leo family of Hawaii received a number of offers for commercial developments at Palmyra, including a repository for spent nuclear fuel and a major resort and casino development. The atoll had also been targeted as a site for a massive fishing and processing operation. In addition to raising the money to cover the costs of acquiring Palmyra, the Conservancy is working to produce a management plan for the atoll. Priorities include protection and enhancement of wildlife habitat and determining how best to manage public access to the atoll. In the waning days of the Clinton Administration, the area was declared to be the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.

The top blue is sky blue, the thin stripe is white for the beach and the turquoise (greenish blue) bottom stripe is for the color of the surrounding ocean. The bird, a Laysan Albatross, is white and black. The flag will first be displayed this coming May 29th. It was designed for the Memorial Day 2000 event being held at the USS Arizona. The flag was designed by the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge staff with assistance of a National Park Service employee. As a number of people have pointed out there is no official documentation of sources and I believe this flag has no official status, other than that it will be used to represent Midway Island in a Memorial Day ceremony. To me the flag has the same status as a small US city's flag - it is accepted as the flag by the inhabitants even though the federal government hasn't given the flag official status. The flag used on the 29th will be 3:5 ratio.

About Midway Islands
Claimed by the US in 1867 under the Guano Act.  A U.S. Navy installation until recent years.  Administered by: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Interior.
Phil Nelson, 25 April 2000

Editorial Note: In 2002, the visitor program which is referred to in the information on the right was suspended.  At present, only U.S. Interior Department personnel and their contractors (approximately 40) remain on the Midway Islands.
This information is provided for historical purposes.

According to the CIA World Factbook:

Midway Islands - 5.2 sq. km., 450 inhabitants - US military personnel; airfield and cable-station; Unincorporated territory of the US administered by the US Navy, under Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific Division; this facility has been operationally closed since 10 September 1993 and is currently being transferred from Pacific Fleet to Naval Facilities Engineering Command via a Memorandum of Understanding.
Jarig Bakker, 29 January 2000
According to one internet site, there are some permanent inhabitants in Midway Islands. I have picked the following text from the same site: ""Current permanent island population totals approximately 150. Guests visiting the Islands are limited to 100 at a time.""
Helge Jacobsen, 20 April 2000

I don't know whether this can be classified as a permanent population. When the US Navy closed its facilities at Midway Island, the island was transferred to the Department of the Interior. Because of the cost of maintaining a protected area so far from the shores, it leased to a private company the right to operate a hotel facility which allows people to view the wildlife in the area as well as the historic sites on the island. Under the contract, the hotel employees and Interior Department employees cannot exceed 150 in number, and the total number of tourists 100. If I recall correctly, the accommodations are former military housing units.

Kingman Reef was annexed by the United States in 1922 and was an experimental aviation station between 1934 and 1938. The island has an area of 1 km2. The highest elevation is 1 meter above sea level.

The unofficial flag would be accepted as a flag of these possessions but in digital form only.
John Moody, 2 March 2018

The flag is described in NAVA News, 208, 2010 and Flaggen, Wappen und Siegel 118, 2017.
Esteban Rivera, 5 March 2018

The flag of Kingman Reef was designed by a sailor who volunteered at the USS Arizona Memorial. To quote Skip Wheeler, he (the designer) originally used the hammer head shark but changed it to a black fin shark that is native to the waters surrounding the reef. Also the lower grey band was originally a moss green but the sailor was uncertain if the reef wasn't just rock, so he substituted the green with a grey.
""The flag is a two colour with the upper two thirds being an aquamarine representing the colour of the reefs water and a medium grey covering the lower third of the flag. In the middle of the design is a native black fin shark"".

There have been a number of versions of this flag that have been put forward. The first version of the Kingman Reef featured a black fin shark facing the flag in natural form. The flag was placed in the middle of the blue band of an unequal horizontal bicolour of aquamarine blue over moss green. The second version of the flag reversed the direction of the black fin shark toward the hoist. The third and final version of this flag had the bottom horizontal strip changed from moss green to grey. The black fin shark was changed to a more cartoon form, the cartoon version of the shark was designed with the assistance of vexillologist Roman Klimes. Two further versions of the Kingman Reef flag were proposed.

Jurisdiction of Kingman Reef was passed from the United States Navy to the Fish and Wildlife office in Honolulu in 2001. The terrorist attack on September the 11th 2001 was a terrible time and the Fish and Wildlife office did not want to get involved with the flag project with the government being bombarded with security measures at that time. So the Kingman Reef flag did not proceed at that time.

With a change of superintendent at the Fish and Wildlife service office in Honolulu Skip Wheeler sent an email to the new superintendent to see if there had been a change of heart on their part regarding the introduction of flags for Baker/Howland and Jarvis Islands along with that of Kingman Reef. This occurred in early 2017. On Friday March 24th Skip received an email from the superintendent stating the her offices (A.U.S.A Federal Agency) has given their approval to release the other two flags (Baker/Howland/Jarvis and Kingman Reef) strictly on an unofficial bases. An official date of approval was stated of July 4th 2017 but unfortunately this did not prove to be the case. Further correspondence with the superintendent Laura McMarlin-Beauregard stated, ""why should they the (Fish and Wildlife service) make an official announcement for a flag that is considered to be unofficial?""
Skip further stated that the Fish and Wildlife service ""Just wanted digital copies of their flag designs to add to their archives"". ""This means no flags need to be manufactured and no announcement needs to be made"". Skip again further stated that ""I assume that the flags of the Department of the Interior (which the Fish and Wildlife service is a sub-agency and will continue to symbolize the four islands (at the USS Arizona memorial).

In short digital copies of the flags only no ""hard copy"" flags will be produced. However these flags have gained a certain currency by appearing on the Flags of the World site under (U.S. minor outlying Islands). The flags also appear on Roberto Breschi's site ""Piccole Isole Del Pacifico"". Also Ben Cahoon's ""Worlds Statesmen"" site in which he has these flags as having been ""adapted 4th July 2017, unofficial"". The common flag of Baker/Howland/Jarvis Island along with the flag of Kingman Reef have gained recognition all be it unofficial. Let us hope at some stage in the future these flags will be represented in hard copy form at the U.S.S Arizona Memorial.

About Johnston Atoll
According to the CIA World Factbook:

Johnston Atoll - 2,8 sq. km., c. 1200 inhabitants; strategic location in the North Pacific Ocean; Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural islands; North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral dredging; closed to the public; former nuclear weapons test site; site of Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS); some low-growing vegetation. Unincorporated territory of the US, administered by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and managed cooperatively by DTRA and the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
Jarig Bakker, 29 January 2000
Johnston Atoll was annexed by both the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States in 1858. In 1936, an airstrip and refueling station was established for aircraft by the U.S. Navy.

Baker Island - 1.4 sq. km., uninhabited; treeless, sparse, and scattered vegetation consisting of grasses, prostrate vines, and low growing shrubs; primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife.  American civilians evacuated in 1942 after Japanese air and naval attacks during World War II; occupied by US military during World War II, but abandoned after the war; public entry is by special-use permit only and generally restricted to scientists and educators; a cemetery and cemetery ruins are located near the middle of the west coast. Unincorporated territory of the US, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
Jarig Bakker, 29 January 2000
And from Pacific Magazine (January/February 2000):

Baker island was reportedly first sighted in 1825 by Captain Starbuck in the ship Lopez, named New Nantucket (and also as Phoebe).  It was in 1832 that a Captain Baker, after whom the island is now named, also came to the island aboard the whaler Gideon Howard.  In 1855, guano from the island was tested, and in 1856 the United States passed the Guano Act, which allowed the United States to claim islands occupied by Americans (and some unoccupied islands were also claimed).  The guano on Baker was used not for fertilizer, but rather for the phosphorus on matchsticks (at least during the US excavation years).  From 1858 until 1870, guano was extracted by the American Guano Company and its subsidiary, Phoenix Guano Company.  The workers were carried to the island by schooner from Honolulu.  During this period several tramways were built from the center of the island to the waterfront, as well as a 400 foot wharf later destroyed by gales. Also during this time, two Chinese sailors in a crew of 9 whose junk was blown off-course were rescued at Baker Island.  From 1886 to 1891,  J. T. Arundel, a mining and copra plantation operation, ran the diggings at Baker Island, bringing in 100 workers from Niue and the Cook Islands.  In 1934, the US rights were reaffirmed by the visit of the USS Astoria to Baker Island.  In 1935, Pan American Airways explored the Pacific Islands for possible refueling and stopover points for their Pacific service (which was a seaplane-based service).  The expedition was aboard the Kinkajou and led by Francis Coman (who was with Admiral Byrd in Antarctica at one time).  Baker was deemed inappropriate for a stopover.  In 1935, the U.S. attempted to colonize Baker Island with four Hawaiian natives, who built a small community named ""Meyerton.""  They were evacuated in 1942 due to the possibility of Japanese invasion.  From September 1943 to May 1944, the island was used as a support area for the American war effort, where 120 officers and 1,200 enlisted personnel built an airstrip.  Remaining from that time is the overgrown airstrip and a building which housed Army Post Office 457.  After the war, a LORAN station was briefly on the island.  Today, the island is a wildlife refuge and there is an unmanned navigational beacon on the island.  The island receives only about 25 inches of rain per year.  The water table has been polluted from the wind leaching the guano into the water sources.

To quote Skip Wheeler from an email sent to me. ""The Howland-Baker-Jarvis design is a definite lift from the American flag. First of all he separated the 3rd and the 4th white stripe which ran both across the entire length of the flag"". ""The 4th red stripe between those two white stripes was also across the entire length of the flag. That makes three alternating white and red stripes in the centre of the flag's length. The canton of the U.S.A. flag covered all of the remaining stripes over and under the three visible stripes. The three stripes symbolize the equator and since there are the three islands (but he never did mention that to me, I guess they symbolize the three islands). The blue is the Pacific Ocean. Baker and Johnston islands are north of the equator and Jarvis lies south of the equator.
""He placed the three stars to represent the island in their geographic positions according to the equator. He then ran a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right and centred the three stars on that line to give the flag a degree of uniformity"".

Actually a well thought out and simple plan and although everyone in his office was supportive of his design his boss thought it was a waste of time and the flag design came to an end. The designer was with the Fish and Wildlife service his name was either Mark or Mike.

Howland Island - 1.6 sq. km., uninhabited; almost totally covered with grass; administered by the US. Department of the Interior (same as Baker Island) - airport constructed in 1937 for scheduled stop on the round-the-world flight of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan - they left Lae, New Guinea, for Howland Island, but were never seen again; the airstrip is no longer serviceable.

""This flag was approved by the Government on 13 February 1945. A number of technical decisions were made at the same time, including the decision that... the strings of the harp be yellow (in settlement of the question raised by Edward MacLysaght, who had insisted that the strings should be white)"".[5] The Presidential Standard was introduced prior to the inauguration of Ireland's second President Seán T. O'Kelly and therefore, it was raised at Áras an Uachtaráin in the presence of President Douglas Hyde on 24 May 1945, a month before the inauguration of his successor on 25 June 1945.[3] The standard is flown over Áras an Uachtaráin and on vehicles used by the president. The flag is never flown at half mast and never takes precedence over the flag of Ireland.

The flag features a blue field and a gold harp with 14 diagonal golden strings.

Flag introduced 13 February 1945 (Hayes McCoy, 1979)
Vincent Morley, 2 February 2002

The traditional arms of Ireland have the harp on a blue field. A gold harp on a green field (as opposed to the blue of the arms) was the traditional Green Flag of Ireland before the tricolour became popular.
Roy Stilling, 30 May 1996

The evolution of the heraldic harp can be traced in Irish coinage. The harp first appeared on coins in the reign of Henry VIII. From the reign of Henry VIII to that of Elizabeth I the fore-pillar of the harp was plain. In the coinages of James I and Charles I it had an animal head. The naked female torso first appeared in the coinage of Charles II (appropriately enough perhaps) and was a permanent feature from then until 1822 when the Irish currency was abolished. The harp adopted as the state emblem on the formation of the Irish Free State is a medieval instrument, the Brian Boru harp, which is preserved in Trinity College Dublin. Use of this particular harp is reserved to the state so all private bodies are obliged to use harps of other designs.
Vincent Morley, 27 January 1997

The harp that appears on the presidential standard differs from that shown on conventional representations of the national arms in being less ornate, in not being tilted into the playing position (i.e. it has diagonal rather than vertical strings), and in having only twelve gold strings rather than a larger number of silver strings. The field of the presidential standard is also in a darker shade of blue than the usual field of the national arms, and the ornamentation on the harp is worked in blue thread of the same shade.

While browsing though the Trust Territory archives at the University of Hawaii library's website, I found a photo of the flagpoles that sat outside the TTPI headquarters in Saipan. The photo shows the HICOM's flag on one pole and US and TTPI flags on the other two poles. The office of High Commissioner lasted until 1986, when the Compacts (and the last bits of the Covenant) went into effect for the F.S. of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. (Palau agreed to a Compact of their own in January 1986, but it took Palau eight years to approve to document. In 1994, the process reached its end. By this time, the office of HICOM and the HICOM's flag had fallen into disuse, with any remaining responsibilities for Palau going to the Interior Department.)

The photo was taken in 1963 by the TTPI Department of Public Affairs Public Information Office. The photo can be found on the University's website with other photos.

The Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation consisting of Member organisations representing 25 European countries.
The program of the European Blue Flag has been working since 15 years.
The countries participating to the program are:

Belgium | Bulgaria | Croatia | Cyprus | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | France | Germany | Greece | Ireland | Italy | Latvia | Lithuania | Netherlands | Norway | Portugal | Slovenia | South Africa | Spain | Sweden | Turkey | United Kingdom

More than 2,400 beaches and marinas are now participating in the programme.
Iceland, Romania, Morocco, Montenegro and the Caribbean are working on establishing the Blue Flag Campaign.
Santiago Tazon & Jan Mertens, 19 June 2003

A booklet published the Blue Flag Organization says that the ""Blue Flag campaign started in Europe in 1987 with the purpose of encouraging beaches to comply with the EU Bathing Water Directive"", and that the project has developed ever since, and as of 2005 the Foundation for Environmental Education, the campaign's managing organization, includes members in 38 countries and an International Jury with representatives of:
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)
International Lifesaving Federation (ILS)
International Council of Marine Industry Associations (ICOMIA)
World Conservation Union (IUCN)
European Union for coastal Conservation (EUCC)
Environmental Education Expert
It is a ""symbol of quality recognized by tourists and tour operators"", and therefore it is not a signal flag, but an award flag. Still according to the booklet, as ""of 2006 there were over 3200 sites awarded with the Blue Flag in 36 countries including countries in Europe, countries in the Caribbean, Morocco, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.""
A previous edition stated that as ""of 2005 there were over 3000 sites awarded with the Blue Flag in 33 countries including 26 countries in Europe, countries in the Caribbean, Morocco, Canada and South Africa"". However, at http://www.fee-international.org/Programmes/blueflag, it says that the Blue Flag was ""awarded in 2007 to more than 3200 beaches and marinas in 37 countries across Europe, Morocco, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the Caribbean"". Note removal and re-addition of New Zealand; cf. http://www.blueflag.org.nz/.
The criteria for awarding the Blue Flag are updated yearly, ""designed to work with the relevant national, regional and local legislation of each country"", and have been ""adapted and expanded to encompass issues encountered in areas outside of Europe"", covering issues of beach and marina ""environmental information and education, water quality, safety and services and environmental management"", says the booklet. Some of these criteria, namely those concerning safety and area uses, may concern the use of signal flags, but the booklet does not expressly mentions that aspect. In countries or regions with where beach safety regulations prescribe flag usage, then the Blue Flag can only be awarded to beaches using them accordingly.
According to the booklet, candidate beach and marinas that ""have been accepted by the International Jury are awarded with the Blue Flag for one season"". These candidates are pre-reviewed by each national jury yearly; the International Jury meets twice a year to review applications from different areas of the world. The booklet also states that ""Control visits are made during the Blue Flag season by both national and international controllers to assure that all criteria are being met. If problems are found the flag is withdrawn until they are fixed. If the problem is very serious or if the problem is not fixed within a given period of time then the flag is withdrawn for the rest of the season.""
António Martins, 12 September 2007

The FEE just e-mailed me to tell that the Blue Flag is not limited to marine sites. Sites at lakes and rivers are awarded as well, but with the limitation already mentioned: they have to apply for it themselves.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 18 September 2007

As that's the same year as the specimen in Sneek, which has just a single year, I asked why Water-sports Zwartsluis (in Zwartsluis) had a double year version, and they told me: This is because they are open all year. Of course, this is not yet the whole story, so I'll try to get more information from the FEE. I expect quite a few town/city harbours in The Netherlands are open all year, simply because nobody ever came up with the idea to lock them down. Yet, I think this is the first time I see a double year version in The Netherlands, so there must be more to it. If I learn more about it, I'll let you know. In the mean time, the Zwartsluis version is a clear indication of the size of the flag. (I know the size, but from my photographs it's not all that visible that the flag is human-sized.)
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 3 June 2023

The Blue Flag is a certification by the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE)[1] that a beach, marina, or sustainable boating tourism operator meets its standards. The Blue Flag is a trademark owned by FEE, which is a not-for-profit non-governmental organisation[2] consisting of 65 organisations in 77 member countries.

FEE's Blue Flag criteria include standards for quality, safety, environmental education and information, the provision of services and general environmental management criteria. The Blue Flag is sought for beaches, marinas, and sustainable boating tourism operators as an indication of their high environmental and quality standards. [citation needed]

Certificates, which FEE refers to as awards, are issued on an annual basis to beaches and marinas of FEE member countries.

12/29/2024 17:16:49,[.] Green Flag Award,"""The Green Flag Award (official websites http://greenflagaward.org/awards/green-flag-award/, http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/) is the benchmark national standard for parks and green spaces in the United Kingdom. The scheme was set up in 1996 to recognise and reward green spaces in England and Wales (that now expands to Northern Ireland as well.). The first awards were given in 1997. It is also seen as a way of encouraging others to achieve the same high environmental standards, creating a benchmark of excellence in recreational green areas. Any free to enter public park or green space is eligible to apply for an Award. The scheme is owned by the Government through the Department for Communities and Local Government, though it is managed by other agents under contract. A pilot scheme was started in 2007 in Scotland and three parks were given awards. Both primary and secondary schools may be awarded the Green Flag in recognition of steps taken towards making the school increasingly eco-friendly.

Parks and green spaces are judged in April and May each year and the winners are announced in July. Parks must apply each year to keep their Green Flag Award, and winning sites are eligible to fly a Green Flag in the park for a year.

Sites for a Green Flag Award are judged against eight key criteria:
- A welcoming place
- Healthy, safe and secure
- Clean and well maintained
- Sustainability
- Conservation and heritage
- Community involvement
- Marketing
- Management""

The Green Flag Award is a green horizontal flag with the logo (http://greenflagaward.org/images/logo-greenflag.png) covering most of the flag, as seen here:

12/29/2024 16:57:49,[NFK] Society of Descendants of Pitcairn Settlers,"The Norfolk Island have a Red Civil Ensign, the society of descendants of Pitcairn Settlers adopted this flag in November 1985. It's based on the flag of H.M.S Bounty.

André Pires Godinho, 20 February 2003

This flag was designed by John Vaughan in 1985 as part of his suite of Australian heritage flags.  I have visited Norfolk Island on three occasions after its claimed adoption and I can advise that I have never seen it in use, nor, on enquiry of residents of Bounty descent, have I located anyone who can recall its existence, even when it is described for them.  The only publications that I am aware of which have shown the flag are a poster by John Vaughan, a Crux Australis [cxa] article by myself (No. 12) and its listing in Longueville Rudy's Badges of the British Commonwealth [lgv96].

Readers should be cautious in ascribing any undue significance to this flag design.  It is correct that it was adopted by the Society of Descendants, however the lack of usage does not support the listing by Rudy that it is a local islander flag.  The Pitcairn Island flag does appear as a decoration in a few shops, suggesting that those who wish to identify with Pitcairn now have an official flag to use. I  note that the Pitcairn flag was only adopted in 1984, and may not have been known to the Norfolk Islanders when they first were presented with Vaughan's proposed design.

Vaughan's design used the pre 1801 British red ensign as its base, to accord with the flag as used at the time of the Bounty mutiny.

https://www.alwihdainfo.com/Tchad-la-culture-Toubou-celebree-au-Ouaddai_a117049.html
Brendan Hennessy, 2 October 2022

This is the cultural Toubou flag. The blue mean the sky and the water, the yellow is the land, and the black star is the tubu african man. The proportion is 5:8. The size of star is give only in cms, 16 cms for a flag 50 cm high.
It seems these ""official"" proportions are not followed in the flags we can see on photos. When yellow is above, star is upside down if is a manufactured flag, but many flags are handmade and some are made all upside down.

Olivier Touzeau, 3 October 2022

As the listed sources reveal, the star has a regular shape on manufactured flags and the shades of blue and yellow are somewhat lighter on them as well, close to the FOTW colors B- (slightly more inclined towards cyan/green) and Y, respectively. The ""star size"" is actually the diameter of the circumscribed circle; that is another detail which varies a lot in the hand-made flags, as do the star shape and its precise position.

On the forehead of the skull is a yin/yang depiction of a dolphin and a whale. The yin and yang expresses our objective of ecological balance and the harmony of interdependence. The dolphin and whale represent the minds in the waters, and the key to that ecological balance is understanding the connections between species that maintain it. 

Below the skull is [sic] the crossed shepherd’s staff and the trident. The shepherd’s crook represents that we are protectors and defenders. The trident represents that our approach is aggressive, but crossed with the crook it means aggressive non-violence.

Juan Manuel Gabino Villascán, 8 December 2002

From www.gov.ky:
The flag of the Cayman Islands was adopted in 1959. Prior to that, the Islands had used the British flag for all official occasions. Set on a navy blue field, the flag features the red, white and blue British Union Jack in its upper left-hand corner, and the Cayman coat of arms encircled in a pure white ground in the right-hand centre of the field. The maritime flag features a red field.

The Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory (the FCO has decreed what we used to call ""colonies"" will no longer to be called dependant territories) has issued A postage stamp in remembrance of 11th September 2001, showing the Statue of Liberty, the US flag, and the Cayman Islands Blue Ensign with the arms in a white disc! The government of the Cayman Islands website shows the flag as is shown on the stamp.
James T. Liston, 14 March 2002 and Dave Cox, 1 April 2002

Here is a response for my letter to Cayman Islands' government web-site www.gov.ky:
""I am writing to you in reference to your enquiry sent to the Portfolio of Internal and External Affairs regarding the Cayman Islands flag. I have examined the National Archive's collection of government records for the relevant time period and I was able to ascertain the following:
- On 3rd April 1957 Cayman's legislative body passed a resolution to seek a grant from Her Majesty for a Coat-of-Arms.
- In a government notice, dated 11th April 1957, Commissioner Donald requested submissions for the Coat-of-Arms based on a template agreed to by the Advisory Executive Council. Deadline for submissions was 1st May 1957.
- According to Government file (ref: CERE/SYMB dated 1958-1974), on 13 January 1957 Her Majesty approved that the design of the Coat-of-Arms should be used on a white circular ground in the fly of the Blue Ensign as the Flag Badge of the territory.
- Government Notice no. 67 of 1958, dated 14 July 1958, published a copy of the Royal Warrant (signed on 14 May 1958) and a sketch of the Arms and Crest.
- The Coat-of-Arms and flag were not recognized in legislation until 1993. It was then revised in 1998 and amended in 2002. The original law specified that the use of the Coat of Arms and Flag is restricted for trade and business and that unauthorized use is subject to penalties. It also provides for the C. I. Government to issue guidelines setting out how the Coats-of-Arms may be used ,and how the flag is to be flown. There is no description of the Flag in the law. The subsequent legislation only pertains to the penalties and fees for use of the Ensign.
- In 1999 the British Ministry of Defence's publication Flags of All Nations (BR 20) removed the white background discs from the illustrations of both the Blue and Red Ensigns. However, the pure white disc remains on the official flag of the Cayman Islands.
In my examination of the records, I was unable to find any archival evidence to suggest a connection between the adoption of the flag and the 1959 Constitution. It should be noted however, that the Constitution does make mention of a ""Public Seal"".
I hope that you will find his response to your enquiry helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact us again, if you have any further
questions.
Yours sincerely,
Tamara Selzer, Archivist""

David Prothero, 7 February 2004

The British Virgin Islands Red Ensign has been authorized since 2001.
See British Virgin Islands (BVI) Merchant Shipping Act, 2001 (No. 13 of 2001), accessible on BVI Ship Registry website.
Section 70 thereof, states as follows:   
(1) The red ensign bearing the Virgin Islands’ coat of arms usually worn by merchant ships, or without the coat of arms, is hereby declared to be the proper national colours for all Virgin Islands ships, except in the case of Her Majesty's ships, or in the case of any other ship for the time being allowed to wear any other national colours in pursuance of a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Admiralty.
(2) If any distinctive national colours, except the red ensign or the Union Jack with a white border or any colours usually worn by Her Majesty's ships or resembling those of Her Majesty, or the pendant usually carried by Her Majesty's ships or any pendant resembling that pendant, are or is hoisted on board any Virgin Islands ship without warrant from Her Majesty or from the Admiralty, the master of the ship, the owner if on board the ship, and every other person hoisting the colours or pendant, each commits an offence and for each such offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five housand dollars.  
James T. Liston, 11 January 2010

I had seen the same type practice as in Bermuda in the British Virgin Islands, only with the colors reversed. This style of BVI red ensign is fairly common in and around the islands. Often times, said BVI red ensigns will be manufactured in the US. Just about every US flag maker who is printing BVI badges makes them up as single units and trims everything in blue.

* The rolling lines of the rolling hills flag are meant to be closer to the reality of the Appalachian mountains for many people, conveying the actual topography of these mountains that many of them call home.

The coat of arms is composed of two white equal crosses, above which we can find a golden crown. Crosses are positioned vertically, meaning that parts of the coat of arms form a column of sorts.

The 'greater' version of the coat of arms can for example be seen above the front door of Gdansks' City Hall.

The history of the city symbols dates back to at least the 13th century, although the official adoption can be assumed to be 1457, when Casimir IV Jagiellon has given the city the current version of this insignia. Before then Gdansk was represented by various other symbols, for example a Hanseatic cog ship was found on one sealed document from the 15th century. Since then the city has used that flag with only one interruption, during the Communist era.

Around it is an oak wreath in orange and green, the oak symbolizing the sacred eternal fire kindled from its wood. The star and wreath lie on a gray circle. Ringing this central circle is an orange band bearing ""Seal of the Cherokee Nation"" in both English and Cherokee script. In Cherokee, it is pronounced Tsa la gi yi A ye hli, meaning ""The Cherokee Nation"" (from a postcard, Seal of the Cherokee Nation). At the base of the orange ring is ""Sept. 6, 1839"", the date of the constitution of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. The seal is edged in green.

Beyond the seal is a ring of seven yellow seven-pointed stars, for the seven original clans. These stars also recall the seven holidays in the Cherokee life cycle and the seven sacred rites of the Native Cherokee religion. The stars are oriented so that each has one point aiming toward the central seal. Edging the entire flag is a border of green and black diagonal stripes similar to the rope-like border frequently found around a seal.

The oil lamp symbolizes knowledge and represents the various educational options within Austin, most notably the University of Texas at Austin located in the city (hence the choice of the orange color). Fimbriating the shield is a narrow gold border. The shield's crest rests on a white wreath. The crest consists of a gold latin cross with white wings outlined in blue protruding on either side. This crest is derived from the coat of arms of the city's namesake, Stephen F. Austin.Austin was known as the ""Father of Texas"" due in large part to his efforts in the colonization and growth of the territory. The cross symbolized that an ancestor of Austin participated in a crusade, while the wings were designed to symbolize Saint Austin, Archbishop of Canterbury, who converted Wales to Christianity. This symbolism would prove important in the 1992 lawsuit. Behind the crest is a silhouette of the Texas State Capitol in red, with a blue outline. This represents its status as the capital city of Texas. Written in blue is the text ""CITY OF AUSTIN"", which is arched counterclockwise in the bottom third of the flag.""",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Flag_of_Austin%2C_Texas.svg/640px-Flag_of_Austin%2C_Texas.svg.png,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Flag_of_Austin%2C_Texas.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Austin%2C_Texas.svg.png,City,1919,0,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Blue, Red, Yellow, White",White,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Austin,_Texas",,[USA] Texas

This flag displays the national coat of arms in banner form. The ratio of the flag is the same as that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the historical national (armorial) flag in law, was proposed by Česlovas Juršėnas, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by Edmundas Rimša, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honour the 750th anniversary of the coronation of Mindaugas in 1253 (anniversary took place in 2003). This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence.

The coat of arms of Suwałki is a escutcheon representing the founding of the settlement by the Camaldolese Hermits of Mount Corona, a Catholic monastic order. In the center there's a Latin cross with a crown midway up, standing on three green hills, representing the location of the monks main monastery in the Monte Corona. The cross is surrounded by the figures of two saints, each on the other side of the shield. On the left we can see St. Romuald, the founder and patron of the Camldolese Hermits order. St. Romuald is wearing a white cowl, with one hand imparting a blessing, and the other one rested on a cane. His head is surrounded by a halo. The person on the right is St. Roch, a Catholic Saint often invoked against plague. He's wearing a tunic, holding one hand on his chest, and the other holding a cane with a drinking gourd. Near his legs there's a small black dog holding bread in his mouth, symbolizing the legend where St. Roch caught a plague during his travels in Italy. In order to prevent spreading his disease he withdrew into a forest and would've perished, had it not been for a Count Gottardo Pallastrellis' dog who supplied the Saint with bread and healed his wounds by licking them.

The history of the coat of arms dates back to 1720, when the city of Suwałki was granted city rights by the King Augustus II The Strong, with the patronage of the monastery. Since then the coat of arms basic idea remained the same, although some minor elements changed - for example, after fall of communism until 2022 the crown was located below the cross which was floating, both saints were in a praying position kneeling, and the dog had no bread.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/POL_Suwa%C5%82ki_flag.svg/640px-POL_Suwa%C5%82ki_flag.svg.png,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/POL_Suwa%C5%82ki_flag.svg/1024px-POL_Suwa%C5%82ki_flag.svg.png,City,"2015, 2022",2,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Yes, and it is not a bird",Dog,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Green, Red, Yellow",Green,"Green, Red",Green,(There is no middle band),Red,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwa%C5%82ki,Silvvy420,[POL] Podlaskie voivodeship

Design
There is designated an official flag for the City to be known as the City Flag and described as follows: The standard size measures 5 feet in length by 3 feet in height. The background shall be green, symbolizing the forests and our green City. The design includes a four-pointed directional star, formed by the vertical and horizontal intersection of counter changed blue stripes, symbolizing our rivers. The blue stripes are paralleled with yellow stripes, symbolizing agriculture and commerce. The yellow stripes are from the green background and the blue river stripes by white lines called fimbriations. The white central star is positioned slightly left of center, toward the staff end of the flag, called the hoist. (Ordinance 176874, amending Portland’s City Code Section 1.06.010.)
The ordinance specifies the components in one-inch units: The star is 9 units high and wide, formed by 4-unit-radius quarter-circles. The center point of the star is 26.5 units from the hoist and 17 units from the top. The canton is 18 units wide by 13.5 units high, the second quarter is 30 units wide and 8.5 units high, the third quarter is 23 units wide and 8.5 units high, the fourth quarter is 25 units wide and 13 units high. The blue stripes are 4 units wide, the white stripes are 1 unit wide, and the yellow stripes are 2 units wide. (These result in a flag 34 units high by 60 units wide.) The colors are Kelly or Irish Green, U.N. Blue, Gold, and White.
Mason Kaye, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003
Symbolism
Green symbolizes Oregon’s forests, which surround Portland. The vertical and horizontal blue stripes represent the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, with the central white star (hypocycloid) signifying Portland at their confluence. The yellow stripes symbolize the harvest of golden yellow grain (Portland is a major international exporter of wheat) and the gold of commerce. The white stripes are merely decorative. The offset cross is not intended to resemble a Scandinavian cross.
Mason Kaye, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003 
Selection
In July of 2002, the Portland Flag Association, including NAVA members Doug Lynch, Mike Hale, Harry Oswald, John Hood, Ted Kaye, and Mason Kaye, proposed an adjusted and improved version of the 1969 flag, with four major changes: removing the city seal from the canton, changing the canton to green, doubling the width of the blue stripes, and enlarging the central star to nine times its former size. Working with the mayor’s chief of staff, Sam Adams, the group drafted the ordinance and testified before city council on behalf of the new flag. Mayor Vera Katz applauded the initiative and oversaw the raising on the council chambers’ pole of the first new flag (manufactured and donated by Elmer’s Flag & Banner).
Flag adopted: 4 September 2002 (official), originally adopted 1969.
Mason Kaye, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003

Designer
Douglas Lynch, 89, a nationally-known, award-winning graphic designer, created this revision of his previous flag. Believing his original design could be simplified, and seeking an opportunity to remove the city seal placed upon it by the former city council, he developed a new version after his presentation to the Portland Flag Association on the history of the 1969 flag.
Mason Kaye, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003

More about the Flag
To allow for normal attrition in flag stocks, the ordinance of adoption made the previous flag equally valid until 31 December 2004. In the 1980s, the city’s Office of Neighborhood Associations sponsored the development and adoption of flags for the city’s 70+ neighborhoods, modeled in proportion (3:4) on the flags of Sienna, Italy. These flags are occasionally displayed in city hall.
Mason Kaye, American City Flags, Raven 9-10, 2002-2003

The City Flag flies in front of the Portland Building (5th Avenue) and City Hall (4th Avenue), in Pioneer Courthouse Square, and on many other commercial buildings around the city. It also hangs in the City Council Chamber and the Portland Building's 2nd-Floor Auditorium.

The arms of Miquelon-Langlade were created in 1984 for the twinning with the Canadian municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
The central green field is a symbol of hope and of the willingness of generations of inhabitants to stay on the island.
The chief features the Acadian flag (vertically divided blue-white-red with a yellow star in canton), recalling the connection of the island with Acadia.
The blue base charged with cods represents the sea and fishing, as the raison d'être of the archipelago.

The emblem superimposed in the center of the flag features a long-tailed duck, a bird locally known as Miquelon duck or kakawit. It was a significant source of food, together with cod, for the early settlers of the island.

The bird is the frigate bird. The color of the bird is white which symbolizes the peaceful state of the village from the ancient to the present time.
The seven red stripes in the flag indicate that Ngardmau was conquered seven times.
The seven yellow stripes in the flag represent the seven pieces of Palauan money that were given to the conquerors so that Ngardmau could be restored to its peaceful lifestyle.
The three stars in the flag represent the three villages that are inhabited today. The three villages are Ngetbong, Ngerutoi, and Urdmau.

The whole bundle of stripes, with their wave crests and abysses, takes up the central 1/3rd of the flag's height, while the disc's diameter is 5/9ths of the flag's height. The flag's overall ratio is 2:3.

In heraldic language, it may be blazoned argent, a saltire gules. Saint Patrick's Flag (Irish: Bratach Naomh Pádraig) is a flag composed of Saint Patrick's Saltire. The origin of the saltire is disputed. Its association with Saint Patrick dates from the 1780s, when the Anglo-Irish Order of Saint Patrick adopted it as an emblem.[1] This was a British chivalric order established in 1783 by George III. It has been suggested that it derives from the arms of the powerful Geraldine or FitzGerald dynasty.[2][3][dubious – discuss] Some Irish nationalists and others reject its use to represent Ireland as a ""British invention""[2] ""for a people who had never used it"".[4]

After its adoption by the Order of Saint Patrick, it began to be used by other institutions. When the Acts of Union 1800 joined the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain, the saltire was added to the British flag to form the Union Flag still used by the United Kingdom. The saltire has occasionally served unofficially to represent Northern Ireland and also appears in some royal events.[5]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire.svg/800px-Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire.svg.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire.svg,Saltire,>1625,2,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Red, White",White,Red,(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire#,u/Geogrartist,N/A

11/23/2024 14:24:04,[IRE] Dublin City Council,"The flag of Dublin was adopted in 1885. The arms of the city, which date from the medieval period, were at first placed in a small square canton on the national flag of the period (a gold harp centred on a green field). The canton has since been enlarged to cover a quarter of the flag, thus displacing the harp towards the fly.
Vincent Morley, 26 October 1996

The official flag used by the city council places three burning castles in the the canton of a green flag which has a large gold harp in the fly. This is the only flag flown by the city authorities - it can always be seen flying at both the mansion house (the residence of the mayor) and the city hall, where the city council meets, and often at other buildings owned by the city council. The flag used by the public, in both the city and Dublin county as a whole (the county covers a larger area than the city) is a dark blue/light blue bicolour - most commonly arranged vertically with the dark blue in the hoist. This flag is commonly seen but has no official status.
Vincent Morley, 13 September 2003

The castle of Dublin first appears in the 13th century seal of the city. On the seal Dublin is clearly under siege, from the central tower two sentries sound the alarm, while on each flanking tower stands an archer with a cross-bow. It probably depicts the readiness of the citizens, not an actual siege. Later, the single tower was replaced by three different castles, the small figures were replaced by flames from the towers. The fire indicates the zeal of the citizens in defence of the city.

A thin horizontal line, blue beneath the shield and red beneath the writing, completes the design. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

The logo is prescribed by Resolution No. 5,332 issued on 30 December 2014 by the regional government, which includes the Graphic Charter of the logo.

The coat of arms of Region Maule highlights the most relevant aspects of the regional identity. It is structured in four fields. The first, upper left field feature two green trees representing a species endemic of the region, called ruil, and accordingly, the region's forest resources. The second, upper right field, features a quill over a book, representing the inhabitants' resplendent wisdom, knowledge and historic and cultural heritage. The third, lower left quarter, features four mountains representing the region's four provinces; red is a symbol of fire, fertility, courage, force and power of the construction of future. The last, lower right field, is horizontally crossed by undulating water, symbolizing the fertility of the soil and the power of the rivers.

The institutional font is gobCL in its Light, Regular, Bold and Heavy variants. [8]

Ruil (Nothofagus alessandrli Espinosa) is an endangered species of southern beech. This species is endemic to Chile. It has a very restricted and fragmented distribution along 100 km of the Coastal Cordillera of Region VII (Provinces Talca, 35 05 S to Cauquenes, 35 50 S) where it has an altitudinal range of between 100 and 450 meters above sea level. Planting of pines has reduced the species area of occupation by 19% from 2016 2017 and the species has an estimated area of occupation of 116 km². The species extent of occurrence has declined by 16% for the same reasons and now estimated extent of occurrence is only 755 km². [9]

The flag with the coat of arms and scroll appears to be used only during official sessions of the regional government.

The raising of the first flag is a regional landmark decentralization and is performed in the 20th anniversary of the regional governments in Chile.

It is a milestone in the country's decentralization. And it is done to mark the twentieth anniversary of the regional governments.

For this reason, the ceremony of hoisting the flag of the Coquimbo region, was chaired by the Regional Council, mayors of 15 municipalities, elected parliamentarians and official and local figures of all political colors, such as former mayors Renan Fuentealba Mario and Sergio Burlé Gahona.

And this because the action had no political colors. This was emphasized bye the regional mayor, José Manuel Fuenzalida. ""Today is an important milestone, we have a milestone that represents us, it is important to identify with this symbol, be proud. It is a topic that cuts across lines, that is beyond political colors. Regionalization.""

During the event delivery was made, by the Regional Directors, of a flag for each mayor of the region, so they are hoisted in every commune and that can start generating regional identity through this symbol.

After that we proceeded to the first official hoisting of the regional emblem, which precedes the creation of the anthem of the region, whose composition will be called a national competition.

On the regional flag
The regional flag was born after the adoption of the graphics manual by rulers of the regional government, which organizes the corporate image of Gore. The image was developed by the company ""Associated Concepts Ltd."" and approved by resolution 729 on May 10, 2000.

Agreement 4715 regulated the graphic standards and the text of the existence of the regional flag.

11/18/2024 2:31:09,[CAN] Mississauga,"The City crest is used on stationery from the Mayor and Councillors. Printed in blue and orange, the crest is symbolic of the industries and development that have prospered in Mississauga.

The Crest depicts the ""story of Mississauga"" through its various illustrations. The water wheel and lighthouse represent the communities of Streetsville and Port Credit which joined with Mississauga to form our current City. The wheat reminds us of our agricultural roots. The wings represent the aviation industry, and the gear represents Mississauga's industry. The laurel leaves depicted under the shield represent honour and distinction. Mississauga’s flag, adopted in 1974, is a slightly altered version of the former flag of the Town of Mississauga. It has proportions of 1:2 (3:5 in usage) and a medium blue field. In the centre is a simple shield, three-eighths the height of the flag, with a horizontal top and vertical sides, curving to a pointed “U” shape. It is divided into four panels, the upper and lower ones forming elongated semicircles almost touching in the centre. The upper panel is medium blue with outspread aviator wings over a vertical stalk of wheat, all in white with black details. The lower panel is orange with a large cogwheel in white, bordered in black, with a small central hole through which can be seen the stem of the wheat stalk running to the base of the shield. In the left panel is a water wheel in three-quarters profile in white with black details; in the right panel is a lighthouse in black with a white window and door. Above the shield arches CITY OF MISSISSAUGA in white sans-serif letters, its width about half the length of the flag. Below the shield are crossed laurel leaves and below them curves INCORPORATED 1974, in smaller letters, all in white. Blue and orange are the city’s official colours. The water wheel and lighthouse gear represents industry. The laurel leaves under the shield symbolize honour and distinction. The city has used different versions of this flag. Al Bauldry, former head draftsman for the City of Mississauga, designed the first Mississauga shield in 1964, which was placed in a white disc on the flag by the city council in 1968. When Mississauga changed its status from town to city in 1974, the council made minor changes to the original shield and thus to the flag for the new city.

The colours 'saffron and white' are most likely taken from traditional saffrondyed linen. This Irish tradition goes back to at least the twelfth century and was
a symbol of status and kingship.

The town of Lisburn in southern Antrim is considered the birthplace of Ireland's
linen industry. The industry was established in 1698 by Huguenot refugees who
had just fled from France. By the early 1900s, Northern Ireland was a world
leader in the production of linen. These origins can be compared to Lithuania,

and red', as these were the colours of Graiguecullen GAA Club, the club
champions since 1908. The club was however expelled from County Carlow in
1926 after an incident during the final against Milford GAA Club, locally
remembered as the 'Battle of Rathoe'. Consequently Graiguecullen moved to
County Laois, only a couple metres away, while Milford was crowned county
champion. The club would win only another Championship, in 1933, the year
Carlow GAA insisted that Milford's yellow was added to the green and red
county colours. It is possible, however, that this happened originally in 1926,
because a register from 1931 describes the Carlow colours as 'red, green and
yellow hoop'.

Atwater, ed., 1887; p. 458), a slightly different design is depicted with an inscription above the disk that reads ""MARE LIBERUM."" On the same page it is mentioned that the original seal was lost and that there had been ""a good deal of discussion as to the lost seal formerly used, but its history has become covered with obscurity.""

In ""Three Centuries of New Haven, 1638-1938"" Rollin Osterweis wrote the following about the original seal:

When our citizens look upon the original seal of their city, they are inspecting the joint handiwork of two distinguished New Haveners, Ezra Stiles and James Hillhouse. Collaborating with them was Josiah Meigs, clerk of the city administration and a tutor on the college faculty. The story of the designing of the seal emerges from entries in Stiles' Diary, during February, 1785. On February 3 the president noted: ""With Messrs. Hillhouse and Meigs devising a City Seal."" Eight days later he wrote triumphantly: ""Finished the City Seal. The Devise, the Harbour of New Haven, a Ship at the Entrance, and an Ionic Pillar entwined with a Grape Vine. Under the Ship at the Mouth of the Harbour, MARE LIBERUM; and round the Seal SIGILL. CIVITAT. NOVI-PORT. IN REPUB. CONNECTICUTENSI. 1784.""
Both the motto ""Mare Liberum"" and the grapevine appear to have been lost to history.

As resolved in June 1888, ""Whereas, the city of New Haven has neither national flag or city flag to display upon said monument; therefore be it resolved, that this post request the city government to provide a national flag and city flag for the soldier's monument..."" It also appears a few references in newspapers a few years after make mention of the city flag, so it is certain that the first city flag of New Haven was adopted in 1888, though I assume it was a very ""basic"" flag, perhaps white with a seal or simply letters, though no information on this exists.

WHEREAS, the Town of Stamford at its annual meeting duty warned and held October 4, 1915, voted as follows:
RESOLVED: that the following seal be adopted as the seal of the Town of Stamford, to wit: A shield divided into four quarters, the first quarter representing the coat of arms of Stamford, in Lincolnshire, England, the second quarter representing in peaceful profile the Indian and the Settler, the third quarter representing an old grist mill and fields of grain, the fourth quarter representing two crossed keys, one of ancient design, and the other of modern design, above the shield an ancient ship and below the shield in a scroll the words, ""Stamford, Connecticut"" and between the scroll and the shield the figures ""1641."" Provided, however that this resolution shall not take effect until a seal conforming to the provisions hereof shall have been prepared and delivered into the possession of the Town Clerk, nor until the holders of the copyright of the device herein described shall have transferred to the Town of Stamford the full and complete perpetual right to use and reproduce said device.

Now THEREFORE RESOLVED: that the President of this Society be authorized to sign and deliver to the Town of Stamford the complete and perpetual right to use, as a seal, the device known as the coat of arms of the Town of Stamford, which device was copyrighted by the Stamford Historical Society, May 9, 1914, and known as copyright No. 74804.

The current flag was first introduced in 1981 and comprises the crest of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada—a crowned lion holding a red maple leaf in its paw, standing on a wreath of red and white (Canada's official colours)—on a blue background. Given the lion in the crest of Canada's arms holds a red maple leaf—which formed the centrepiece of the National Flag adopted in 1965—the need for the scroll showing Canada's name was eliminated.[1] The only other national viceregal flags that differ from the norm are the flag of the governor-general of New Zealand[1]—which displays the crowned shield of the coat of arms of New Zealand on a blue field—and the flag of the governor-general of Solomon Islands—which uses the common form, but with the name of the country written across a gold silhouette of a two-headed frigatebird.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg,,Viceregal standard ,"1869,1999,2002, present ",0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,"Yes, and it is not a bird",Lion,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,(No Stars),"Black, Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, White",Blue,(No Bands),(There is no first band),(There is no middle band),(There is no last band),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg/1920px-Flag_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg.png,,

Vermont's Capital City Gets a New Flag, Because Why Not?
This evening, Montpelier City Councilor Anne Watson and City Clerk John Odum unveiled the state capital's new flag during the annual July 3rd celebrations.
The minimalist winning design, by East Montpelier native Chet Larrow, features rolling green hills topped by a navy-blue sky. Centered in the blue field is a circle of 14 golden stars. Larrow is an industrial designer for Key Technologies in Baltimore, Md.
In a press release issued earlier today, Larrow is quoted as saying his entry ""emphasizes Montpelier's representation of the 14 counties as well as [Vermont] being the 14th state to join the union. The gold stars are displayed in a circle to subtly represent the iconic round dome that both visitors and locals come to associate the city with.""
Larrow's design was one of three finalists, chosen from about 60 submissions, said Odum.
The new flag is a replacement for a hasty design implemented in 2001 to satisfy a request for a city flag to be used in California's Rose Parade. Up until that point, Montpelier didn't have one.
The banner will be formally adopted on Wednesday, July 12, at the next city council meeting, then will be raised in front of city hall to proudly wave.

4/4/2025 17:12:54,[.] Agender Flag,"The original agender flag was designed by the Tumblr user Transrants aka Salem in 2014.[6] Black represents an absence of gender, grey represents those who have a partial gender, and green represents the non-binary nature of this gender because green is the inverse of lavender (a mixture of pink and blue, representing a mix of female and male). Variations on the agender flag usually include green and black.

An alternate agender flag was designed by Reddit user angerywaman on May 6, 2020[7], The colors are based on a sunset, representing the sun setting on gender. Purple represents androgynous presenting agender individuals. Pink represents feminine presenting agender individuals. Orange represents masculine presenting agender individuals. Yellow represents all agender individuals. The in between colors represent those who have a mix of presentations.

The ""citrus agender"" flag variants by Mars in 2021. Turquoise or dark green represents leaves and stands for working towards agender liberation. Green represents limes and stands for agender friendship, love, and community. Yellow represents lemons and stands for gender joy and celebration. Orange represents oranges and stands for gender artwork and creativity. Red represents blood oranges and stands for agender diversity and individual expression.

Several agender symbols exist. The most common is a circle (in reference to the male and female symbols and many other gender symbols), with a line through it, either horizontally or diagonally (∅), likely representing gender being crossed out and absent. Another variant includes a line without prongs, similar to the neutrois symbol. Another, less common agender symbol is a plain circle (⚪), though this symbol is also sometimes used to represent asexuality.",https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender#/media/File:The_agender_flag.png,https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agender#/media/File:Agender_pride_flag.svg,Social,2014,7,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,0,(No Stars),"Black, Green, White, Gray",Equal Distribution,"Black, Green, White",Black,Green,Black,https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender#Flags_and_symbols,u/Geogrartist,[.] Pride Flags

On the square in front of the old Town Hall, an impressive number of flag poles all had this pennant.  On other occasions (as shown on local post cards) these are used for various rectangular flags.
One restaurant showing the city flag had a dark-red background with a bright red shield but I'm inclined to believe this was an error in manufacturing.
Festive cream-coloured hanging banners celebrating Mindaugas's coronation, 750 years ago, were to be seen in a few places.  They consisted basically of a dark, crowned capital letter ""M"" ; the largest I saw, a white one (in Knatterfahne fashion) flew in front of the (Catholic) Cathedral showing some additional text and accompanied by a city pennant.

Jan Mertens, 15 August 2003

Vilnius city casual - WRONG colour on FOTW: the main field must be purpure (dark red), not red. On purpure field with narrow yellow fess the small arms of Vilnius city: St. Christopher with infant Jesus. Flag proportions the same as of representational flag. No decorations. I have no picture, because in the book there is only the representational flag shown. Also the statement about proportions is intentionally citated: see below about ambiguity.
Virginijus Misiunas, 05 November 2009

The answer from Vilnius City municipality is very reliable and comprehensive: they've sent a copy of Vilnius City Municipal Council's 18/07/2007 act No.1-120 ""About the confirmation of description of Vilnius City heraldry digital variant, arms and flag usage"".
The answer is sent by Violeta Kolonaitiene, the senior specialist of Culture and art division. Also I acknowledge Vitas Karciauskas, the manager of Culture and heritage division, and Kristina Uleviciute, the director of Culture, sport and tourism department, for the care about my request.
The proportions of flag are 2:3, i.e. the description in the ""Heraldry of Lithuania"" book is wrong in this detail, but the picture is correct. The fess is 1/10 of height, i.e. the horizontal stripes are purpure-yellow-purpure 9-2-9. The main field shall be purpure / dark red (Pantone 188). The fess is yellow (Pantone 130). Colours of arms (Pantone): golden 123 C, yellow 1235 C, silver 427 C, red 1795 C, and codes of green and brownish (both used only on the greater arms) are not described.
The Vilnius City casual and representational flags are of the same proportions, and the same elements have the same sizes. Just the additional elements of greater arms (supporters, motto and wreath) and of representational flag itself (border, fringe, finial and bands) should be added.
So the actual picture of Vilnius City casual flag is not correct, neither the proportions not the colors. I think the flag of country capital should have a little higher priority than usual.

Pascal Vagnat, 14 December 1997
Bratislava is the capital city of the Republic of Slovakia since the split of the former Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia in 1992. It is ""a fantastic small big city"" (official tourist slogan for 2006), with 425,208 inhabitants and an area of 367.9 sq. km.

The castle of Bratislava was built near the Danube; it was mentioned in 907 as Brezalauspruch in the Solnohradske papers. In the Xth century, the castle became the border guard of the newly established Hungarian kingdom as well as the king's residence. The village located at the foot of the castle became the city of Bratislava, known in German as Pressburg and in Magyar as Poszony. In 1291, King Andrew II granted a special status to the town, then already famous for its markets, traders, craftsmen and wines. King Sigmund of Luxembourg (1368-1437; King of Hungary in 1387; King of the Romans, 1411-1433; German Emperor in 1433; and King of Bohemia in 1419) fortified the castle in the XVth century; in 1430, the town was granted the privilege to mint coins. The oldest university of Slovakia, Academia Istroplitana, was founded in Bratislava in 1465; its building can still be seen along with other noble palaces in the Venturska street, one of the oldest streets of the town.
From 1536 to 1830, Bratislava was the capital city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had there the seat of the king, the archbishop and most institutions of the country. During that period, eleven kings and eight queens of Hungary were crowned in the St. Martin's cathedral. Since 2003, a coronation celebration has been organized in Bratislava on the first weekend of September; in 2006, the town will commemorate Mathias II's coronation, the fourth in the line. A 1 m high replica of the royal crown can be seen in the cathedral, where Beethoven's Missa Solemnis was played for the first time.

The Main Square of Bratislava is decorated with Maximilian II's fountain, locally known as Roland's Fountain. The legend says that once per year at midnight, the statue of Sir Roland turns around its axis. However, this can be only seen by true virgins.
The modern symbol of the city is the controversial new bridge built over the Danube, the seventh largest suspended bridge in the world. The bridge is surmonted by the UFO restaurant.

The flag display is there different from what I have seen: I saw vertical flags (with the national coat of arms properly rotated on the national flag) whereas Kermarrec saw horizontal flags (with the coat of arms not rotated) displayed vertically, and a fourth flag I cannot identify.

4/9/2025 22:41:00,[SVK] Bratislava Region,"Today I recieved an answer from ""Urad Bratislavskeho samospravneho kraja"" regarding its flag. The attached image was made in Microsoft Excel (!) and  presented as hanging vertically. It is another example of ""Kosice pattern"".
Description ( from the hoist to the fly): quartered field with vertical line in 1/3 of the field (although we see it like a horizontal line :-); first and 4th fields are blue (i. e. upper left and lower right field), 2nd field (upper right one) is yellow and 3rd field (lower left) white. So probably the white field would be upper fly, if the flag were horizontally hung.
It really seems like try to introduce an official model for regional flags in Slovakia, however Trencín and Presov  Regions spoiled this ""splendid unity"" with striped fields.
Aleš Křížan, 4 Dec 2002
This site (at this time working - click ""Symboly"") shows it with yellow field in canton (upper hoist) and white field in lower fly. There is also bigger image of Coat of Arms (wavy bar represents rivers Danube, Morava and their confluence in Bratislava - Devin) and official seal.

4/9/2025 22:45:54,[SVK] Trenčín Region,"The Slovakian region of Trenčín has its own emblems: coat of arms, flag, seal and presidential standard.
The picture of the coat of arms can be found in the website of that region. There is an explanation (in Slovakian) concerning it at:
this page. The coat of arms is made with historical coats of arms coming from the Trenčin and Nitra regions.
At this page are some explanations (Slovakian) concerning the flag as well as a picture. The flag (attached here), of ratio 2:3, is made of four horizontal stripes: blue-white-red-blue (1-2-2-1). The colours are coming from the coat of arms.
The picture at the page quoted above isn't right: the width of the blue stripes is bigger and the ratio of the flag more 1:2 than 2:3. The text says clearly that the width of the blue stripes together is 1/3 the width of the flag, the width of the white and red stripes together making 2/3 of the width of the flag.

There is also a standard for the president of the region on this page (without image so far). From the pieces of pictures found in the directory of the page, I managed to make an incomplete puzzle. I could only understand that there is a white lozenge and red-blue borders and that the regional coat of arms may in the middle. Can anyone understand the text?
Pascal Vagnat, 20 Aug 2002

I have understood it as badly as Mr. Vagnat explained it. Although his translation is brilliant - they really  used the word ""kosoctverec""/lozenge describing the Chairman's Standard (Štandarta predsedu samosprávneho kraja). I cannot imagine such a flag.
Concerning the explanations of the Arms: the Deer is from Trenčin County seal, eagle is from the arms, which was granted later and the rest is from Nitra County Arms. This Arms showed (and shows again!) following historic scene: King Ladislas (László) the Saint is killing by battle axe a wild Cumanian.

According to what I understand, the emblems were adopted on the 27th March 2002 with the regional ""law"" n° 5/2002. The colours of the flag are coming from the coat of arms.
The coat of arms seems to be made of four historical coats of arms, from the XVIIth c.
The text mentions the existence of a standard for the president of the region, with no picture.
