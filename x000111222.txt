Pressing on buttons often does nothing. I just finished this puzzle but cannot start the challenge mode. The only way I found to play a puzzle from the archive is to click on it (which by itself doesn't do anything) then reload the page. However my progress is only sometimes saved - some puzzles in the archive that I have solved already look just like those I've never started, making it more difficult to select a new one. The game is a fun idea, but I wish the website was a bit more usable so I could actually enjoy it. (on firefox browser) [ANSWER: We are working on improving the website, thanks for reporting these!
