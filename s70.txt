In the Middle Ages the Åland archipelago was a province of Sweden. Ecclesiastically the islands belonged to the diocese of Abo (Turku) in Finland, and so the province was lost to Russia in 1809. The issue was finally settled by the League of Nations in 1921. The islands were to be a part of Finland, but they were to enjoy autonomy.\n\nHowever, a flag was not granted until 1954. Unofficially a blue-yellow-blue triband had been in use from 1922. Several versions existed, the dominating one had equal horizontal bands. Another version had a narrower band of yellow - as when the vertical yellow stripe in the cross on the Swedish flag is taken away.\n\nBlue and yellow were naturally the favourite colours, being both the colours of Sweden and the colours of the provincial coat of arms (a golden deer on blue), Therefore, when preparing a design for adoption in the early 1950s, the favoured design was a Scandinavian cross design of a blue field and a yellow and blue cross - that is, the flag of Sweden with an extra blue cross in the middle. This proposal was rejected by the president of Finland as too similar to the Swedish flag. Alternative designs were the old blue-yellow-blue triband, the flag of Finland with an extra yellow cross in the middle, and a design where a red cross was added to the Swedish pattern.\n\nThe outcome of the process was the adoption of the blue-yellow- red Scandinavian cross design. This flag was first hoisted on the town hall in the provincial capital Mariehamn 3 April 1954. The red colour was controversial at first, because people felt it lacked a local tradition. However, the colours can be said to come from the provincial coat of arms (blue and yellow - also Sweden's colours) and the colours of the coat of arms of Finland (red and yellow). Also, experts in heraldry have found out that at one point a Swedish king hoisted a flag of exactly the same design.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Åland"}, {"couname":"Albania","year":"1443, 1912, 1992, 2002 ","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"Items":["3Color","lets07","startA","LUELHI","year19","year00","NoBand","Animal","Bird","Center","NO_RED","NO_GRE","NO_BLA","myrBLU","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle, traditionally the symbol of Albanians, represents the sovereign state of Albania. ", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania"}, {"couname":"Algeria","year":"1962 ","region":"rgn_Africa","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"Items":["3Color","lets07","startA","LUELHI","year19","allver","smallc","2Bands","Vertic","IsMoon","Center","staRED","NO_RED","NO_GRE","NO_BLA","myrBLU","HasSta","1Stars"],"Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/k6GbsFg/Algeria-Flag.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Algeria.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe flag aims to highlight Algeria's cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements.

Red stands for the blood shed during the struggle for independence, yellow stands for the sun, and green represents hope.\n\nThe flag features the traditional Pan-African colors of gold, green, red, and also the Black Star of Africa.

However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white panji or pataka (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom's banner in the Kediri era (1042 – c.1222).\n\nRed and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa bilimbi, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.\n\nIt was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called piso gaja dompak against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called Woromporang. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).\n\nIn the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled Gedenkboek 1908-1923 run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia ('Indonesian Association'). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule. It became the flag adopted by the Kesatuan Melayu Muda to symbolise Malay nationalism against European colonialism. Upon Indonesia's declaration of independence on 17 August 1945, it was adopted as the national flag, and has been in use ever since. After Indonesia's independence was recognized, Monaco, which had a similar flag, filed a complaint which was largely ignored.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Indonesia"}, {"couname":"Iran","year":"1907 ","region":"rgn_Asia","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_GRE","cl_YEL","cl_ORA","cl_BRO","cl_WHI"],"Items":["5+Colo","lets04","startI","year19","allhor","3Bands","Horizo","Plants","Texted","Weapon","Center","NO_RED","NO_BLA","myrWHI","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/GPz0Lx6/Iran-Flag.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe colour scheme of green, white and red symbolise Islam, peace and bravery respectively.

This influence was clear when Senegal linked with the Sudanese Republic (now Mali) in the Mali Federation on April 4, 1959, and adopted a vertical tricolour of green-yellow-red with a central representation in black of a human figure known as the kanaga. Independence followed on August 20, 1960, but the federation ended and Senegal became a separate country with its own flag in September. \n\nSenegal retained the green-yellow-red flag but substituted a green star for the kanaga. Green is seen as a symbol of hope and of the country’s major religions, while yellow is for natural riches and the wealth derived from labour.

The long shadow it casts forms the unmistakable shape of a compass arrow pointed south, an homage to the continent's legacy of exploration.

However, this was curiously changed to a blue band in 1891 to avoid confusion with the Russian naval flag.\n\nBy removing a part of the Cross of St. Andrew from the flag, one of the arms was left, giving rise to the current blue stripe that crosses the Galician flag. Around this autonomous flag and its inspiration from the Coruñan authority's flag, a story has been passed down from generation to generation.\n\nDuring the 19th century, thousands of Galicians emigrated each year to America to escape the economic and political crisis that plagued Galicia and Spain in general. The main port from which all the ships departed was A Coruña, where the naval command was precisely located.\n\nAccording to tradition, this flag was the last one Galician emigrants saw before leaving their land to head to the Americas. They had it so present in their minds that upon arriving at their new destination, they used it to remember the Galicia they left behind.\n\nThe number of crosses on the Galician coat of arms has also varied over the centuries.

Council Members voted in favour of the version of Rēzekne’s coat of arms that was used during the first period of Latvia’s independence.\nAs several coats of arms previously used by local communities did not correspond to the idea of an independent country, in 1923 a special heraldry commission was established in Latvia. At that time, the official symbol of Latgale was a griffin (facing the left side) that is holding a sword. The same griffin (representing the wish to be considered as the heart and the capital city of Latgale) was placed in the centre of the Rēzekne city coat of arms adopted in 1925. It features a golden (yellow) griffin, an ancient mythological creature with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle, on a sky-blue background.\nAs a matter of fact, according to heraldry regulations, the griffin should be depicted holding a sword, but in the coat of arms of Rēzekne the sword was replaced with a shield in the colours of the Latvian national flag, thus emphasising that the city belongs to the country.

In the process, this design was chosen from some dozens of entries with a 23% victory of the votes. The flag serves as a symbol for the region and as a means of representing its identity. The flag has a green background with three narrow vertical stripes in red and blue on the mast side. These stripes are derived from the coat of arms of the noble family de Cocq van Haeften. They played an important role in the region during the Middle Ages. This coat of arms was also often used as inspiration for arms of various (disbanded) villages and towns in the Batavia. The stripes symbolise all these places. The green background refers to the region's landscape: lots of woods, heathland and other nature. Placed on top are two wavy horizontal stripes referring to the rivers Waal and Rhine. Central to the flag are three silhouettes of apples. These refer to the three Batavia regions that make up the area: the Tielerwaard, Lower Batavia and Upper Batavia.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flags_of_the_Netherlands"}, {"couname":"[NED] Brabant","year":"1300","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_RED","cl_YEL"],"Items":["3Color","lets07","startB","LAEDEL","NoBand","Animal","Center","NO_BLU","NO_WHI","NO_GRE","WHGRNO","BLWHNO","WHRENO","myrBLA","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Banner_of_the_Duchy_of_Brabant.svg/320px-Banner_of_the_Duchy_of_Brabant.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Banner_of_the_Duchy_of_Brabant.svg/800px-Banner_of_the_Duchy_of_Brabant.svg.png","type":"Region", "describe": "\nThe flag is black and features the well-known Brabantian or Flemish lion.

His elder son Peter, who had declared the independence of Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Pedro I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Pedro IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Pedro stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started the period of the Liberal Wars.\n\nThe liberals formed a separate government exiled on the Azorean island of Terceira. This government issued two decrees establishing modifications to the national flag. While supporters of usurper King Miguel I still upheld the flag established by João VI, the liberal supporters imposed important changes on it. The background was equally divided along its length into blue (hoist) and white (fly); the armillary sphere (associated with Brazil) was removed and the coat of arms was centred over the colour boundary; and the shield reverted to the 'French type' shape of João V. This new flag configuration was decreed solely for terrestrial use, but a variation of it was used as the national ensign. This ensign differed in the way the colours occupied the background (blue 1⁄3, white 2⁄3) with a consequent positional shift of the arms.\n\nWith the defeat and exile of Miguel in 1834, Queen Maria II returned to the throne and the standard of the victorious side was hoisted in Lisbon as the new national flag. It was in use for 80 years, witnessing the last period of the Portuguese monarchy until its abolition in 1910. Currently this flag is used by Portuguese monarchists. The Independence Day parade of Brazil also presented this flag in the standard marchpast, along with other historical flags of Portugal and Brazil.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Portugal#1830%E2%80%931910"}, {"couname":"[PRC] Bayamon","year":"1977 ","region":"rgn_North America","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"Items":["3Color","lets07","startB","with_y","LAELHI","year19","4+Band","Crosse","Horizo","Vertic","Nordic","OnlyBa","NO_BLU","NO_RED","NO_GRE","BLRENO","myrBLA","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_Bayamon.svg/640px-Flag_of_Bayamon.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_Bayamon.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Bayamon.svg.png","type":"Municipality", "describe": "\nThe white and blue represent the waters of the Río Bayamón and remind us that the first hydraulic mill in Puerto Rico was built along this river.

One theory is that it was developed to fly atop Anglican churches in Wales (possibly with colours reversed as a black cross on a yellow field) in the same way that the St George's Cross was flown outside churches in England, but since 1954 churches are more likely to fly a flag of the Church in Wales based on its armorial badge granted that year.

St David's University College, Lampeter (now the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), founded in 1822, adopted these colours as the 'college colours' in 1888, and the flag of St David continues to be associated with the college and is often flown today in a form defaced to include the cinquefoils of the crest of St Davids College.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Saint_David"}, {"couname":"[YEM] Kingdom of Yemen (1918-1970)","year":"1927","region":"rgn_Asia","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_BLU","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"Items":["4Color","words2","words3","lets24","startK","with_y","year19","NoBand","Weapon","Center","staWHI","NO_RED","NO_GRE","001WHI","003BLU","myrBLU","histor","HasSta","3+Star"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Flag_of_the_Mutawakkilite_Kingdom_of_Yemen.svg/640px-Flag_of_the_Mutawakkilite_Kingdom_of_Yemen.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Flag_of_the_Mutawakkilite_Kingdom_of_Yemen.svg/2560px-Flag_of_the_Mutawakkilite_Kingdom_of_Yemen.svg.png","type":"Historical", "describe": "\nThe five stars represent the five natural geographic divisions of Yemen; they also recall the Five Pillars of Islam, and the five times a day the prayers are recited by the faithful.

The background of the flag consists of seven diagonal stripes in white and blue. Eleven red hearts are distributed across the white stripes. These hearts are also called 'water rose plums'. What these refer to is not exactly known.

There is a golden crown located above the escutcheon, which was added in 1997.\n\nThe symbolism of the elements of the coat of arms is:\n- The city wall represents the city rights Poznań received on the basis of the Magdeburg law.\n- The saints represent the patrons of the diocese of Poznań.\n- The eagle shield represents the seal of Przemysł I, The Duke of Greater Poland, who granted Poznań the city rights, and also the seal of Przemysł II, the King of Poland, who ruled from this city.\n- The keys represent municipal self-government, and the cross represents Christianity.\n- The crown above the shield represents the history of Poznań as a capital.\n- Finally, it's unclear what the stars/crescents are supposed to mean. It is suspected they're connected to the Leliwa coat of arms, a noble symbol used by many Polish-Lithuanian aristocratic families.\n\nThe oldest known usage of this coat of arms dates back to 1344 . Since then it mostly remained the same, although depending on the era there were some minor adjustments, for example during the Polish People's Republic the eagle had no crown, like the national coat of arms during that era.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Pozna%C5%84"}, {"couname":"[POL] Przemyśl","subtype":"[POL] Subcarpathian Voivodeship","year":"2005","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_WHI","cl_RED","cl_YEL","cl_GRE","cl_BRO","cl_BLU"],"Items":["5+Colo","lets08","startP","with_y","with_z","year00","dgband","alldia","largec","NoBand","Crosse","Animal","Center","NO_BLA","myrWHI","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/POL_Przemy%C5%9Bl_flag.svg/640px-POL_Przemy%C5%9Bl_flag.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/POL_Przemy%C5%9Bl_flag.svg/1024px-POL_Przemy%C5%9Bl_flag.svg.png","type":"City", "describe": "\nThe flag of Przemyśl is an modified version of coat of arms of the city.

This widely popularized the theta symbol, which is associated with the Greek word thanatos (death), pointing to human threats to the environment and atmosphere of the earth. Shepherd patterned the flag after the flag of the United States, with thirteen stripes alternating green and white, the green standing for unspoiled land and the white for clean air.

After India's independence in 1947, the constitutional changes took nearly three years to come into effect, during which the Kingdom of Mysore remained the state's original form territorially. In 1950, the Kingdom of Mysore was renamed Mysore State when India became a democratic republic, but Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar continued to be the chief head of Mysore State. In 1956, the Reorganisation of States Act on a linguistic basis was passed by the Republic of India, which furthered Mysore State's frontiers. Coastal parts of Mangalore, which previously belonged to Madras Presidency, were incorporated into Mysore State, as well as Kannada-speaking regions of Bombay Presidency and Hyderabad State. In 1974, Mysore State was renamed Karnataka State. Until this point, the flag of the Kingdom of Mysore remained the state's flag, official until 1956, and de facto thereafter, until 1974, alongside the bi-coloured Kannada flag. With the renaming of the state, pro-Kannada movements throughout Karnataka gained pace, during which the bi-colored Kannada flag became more prevalent.\n\nThe Mysore Kingdom flag was oblong and bi-colored: a red strip on the top, symbolizing vermilion, and a maroon strip on the bottom. In the center was inscribed the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Mysore. Some synonymous versions of the flag redact the emblem; the original version, however, comes with it inscribed in the center. The coat of arms bore a mythical two-headed eagle, called Gandabherunda, in Kannada. This emblem itself was an adoption from that of the Vijayanagara Empire. Mysore Kingdom inherited this right after the principality was commissioned in 1399 by Harihara II, anointing Mysore Kingdom's first ruler, Yaduraya Wodeyar, as its ruler.\n\nAfter the state's renaming in 1974, this flag was gradually decommissioned. Nevertheless, this flag remains, to this day, the official flag of the Mysore royal family, and is used during the private and, sometimes, in public, celebrations of the Dasara festival, including the Special Assembly during the carnival.", "isnew": ".", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Karnataka#Kingdom_of_Mysore_(1880s%E2%80%931974)"}, {"couname":"[IND] Kannada Flag","year":"1962","region":"rgn_Asia","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_RED","cl_WHI"],"Items":["3Color","words2","exact2","lets11","startK","LUEDHI","year19","allhor","2Bands","Horizo","Unequa","OnlyBa","NO_GRE","NO_YEL","NO_BLA","001BLU","002RED","003BLU","myrEQ","spanis","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Flag_of_the_Kannada_people.svg/320px-Flag_of_the_Kannada_people.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Flag_of_the_Kannada_people.svg/800px-Flag_of_the_Kannada_people.svg.png","type":"People", "describe": "\nThe Kannada flag is a flag that is popular in the state of Karnataka, India.

The Supplementary Fundamental Laws of 7 October 1907 described the flag as a tricolour of green, white, and red, with a lion and sun emblem in the middle. A decree dated 4 September 1910 specified the exact details of the emblem, including the shape of the lion's tail and the position and the size of the lion, the sword, and the sun.\n\nDuring this period, the colours of the flag were very pale, with the red appearing closer to pink in practice. There were three variants of the flag in use. The state flag was a tricolour with the lion and sun emblem in the centre. The national flag and civil ensign was a plain tricolour with no emblem. The naval ensign and war flag was similar to the state flag, but the emblem was surrounded by a wreath and surmounted by a crown.

A second theory states that it is based on the colors of the primitive coat of arms of Christopher Columbus, and lastly, a third theory says that it is based on the colors of the uniforms of the Burgerwache in Hamburg. The first theory is based in a letter, where Miranda describes a conversation with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about its Theory of colours at a party hosted in the city of Weimar in 1785. The santeños Patriots took this model to represent Los Santos in 1821 in the battle to gain independence from Spain.

But in the 1910s Dr. Manuel Segundo Sánchez, director of the National Library of Caracas, challenged the notion that the tricolour had been flown as the naval flag of Leander. At the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, Sanchez had uncovered correspondence of the Spanish colonial authorities which included a facsimile drawing of a naval flag used by Miranda in 1806.
