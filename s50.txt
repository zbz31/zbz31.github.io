In the Middle Ages the Åland archipelago was a province of Sweden. Ecclesiastically the islands belonged to the diocese of Abo (Turku) in Finland, and so the province was lost to Russia in 1809. The issue was finally settled by the League of Nations in 1921. The islands were to be a part of Finland, but they were to enjoy autonomy.\n\nHowever, a flag was not granted until 1954. Unofficially a blue-yellow-blue triband had been in use from 1922. Several versions existed, the dominating one had equal horizontal bands. Another version had a narrower band of yellow - as when the vertical yellow stripe in the cross on the Swedish flag is taken away.\n\nBlue and yellow were naturally the favourite colours, being both the colours of Sweden and the colours of the provincial coat of arms (a golden deer on blue), Therefore, when preparing a design for adoption in the early 1950s, the favoured design was a Scandinavian cross design of a blue field and a yellow and blue cross - that is, the flag of Sweden with an extra blue cross in the middle. This proposal was rejected by the president of Finland as too similar to the Swedish flag. Alternative designs were the old blue-yellow-blue triband, the flag of Finland with an extra yellow cross in the middle, and a design where a red cross was added to the Swedish pattern.\n\nThe outcome of the process was the adoption of the blue-yellow- red Scandinavian cross design. This flag was first hoisted on the town hall in the provincial capital Mariehamn 3 April 1954. The red colour was controversial at first, because people felt it lacked a local tradition. However, the colours can be said to come from the provincial coat of arms (blue and yellow - also Sweden's colours) and the colours of the coat of arms of Finland (red and yellow). Also, experts in heraldry have found out that at one point a Swedish king hoisted a flag of exactly the same design.", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Åland"}, {"couname":"Albania","year":"1443, 1912, 1992, 2002 ","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_BLA"],"Items":["2Color","lets07","startA","year00","NoBand","Animal","Bird","Center","NO_BLU","NO_WHI","NO_GRE","NO_YEL","WHGRNO","WHYENO","BLWHNO","WHRENO","myrRED","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle, traditionally the symbol of Albanians, represents the sovereign state of Albania. ", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania"}, {"couname":"Algeria","year":"1962 ","region":"rgn_Africa","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],"Items":["3Color","lets07","startA","2Bands","Vertic","IsMoon","Center","staRED","NO_BLU","NO_YEL","NO_BLA","001GRE","003WHI","myrEQ","arabic","HasSta","1Stars"],"Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/k6GbsFg/Algeria-Flag.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Algeria.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe flag aims to highlight Algeria's cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements.

However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white panji or pataka (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom's banner in the Kediri era (1042 – c.1222).\n\nRed and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa bilimbi, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.\n\nIt was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called piso gaja dompak against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called Woromporang. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).\n\nIn the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled Gedenkboek 1908-1923 run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia ('Indonesian Association'). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule. It became the flag adopted by the Kesatuan Melayu Muda to symbolise Malay nationalism against European colonialism. Upon Indonesia's declaration of independence on 17 August 1945, it was adopted as the national flag, and has been in use ever since. After Indonesia's independence was recognized, Monaco, which had a similar flag, filed a complaint which was largely ignored.", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Indonesia"}, {"couname":"Iran","year":"1907 ","region":"rgn_Asia","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_GRE"],"Items":["3Color","lets04","startI","3Bands","Horizo","Plants","Texted","Weapon","Center","NO_BLU","NO_YEL","NO_BLA","001GRE","002WHI","003RED","myrEQ","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/GPz0Lx6/Iran-Flag.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png","type":"", "describe": "\nThe colour scheme of green, white and red symbolise Islam, peace and bravery respectively.

This influence was clear when Senegal linked with the Sudanese Republic (now Mali) in the Mali Federation on April 4, 1959, and adopted a vertical tricolour of green-yellow-red with a central representation in black of a human figure known as the kanaga. Independence followed on August 20, 1960, but the federation ended and Senegal became a separate country with its own flag in September. \n\nSenegal retained the green-yellow-red flag but substituted a green star for the kanaga. Green is seen as a symbol of hope and of the country’s major religions, while yellow is for natural riches and the wealth derived from labour. Red recalls the independence struggle, life, and socialism.

The latter, since 1845, consisted of a blue saltire on a white background, the so-called Cross of St. Andrew. However, this was curiously changed to a blue band in 1891 to avoid confusion with the Russian naval flag.\n\nBy removing a part of the Cross of St. Andrew from the flag, one of the arms was left, giving rise to the current blue stripe that crosses the Galician flag. Around this autonomous flag and its inspiration from the Coruñan authority's flag, a story has been passed down from generation to generation.\n\nDuring the 19th century, thousands of Galicians emigrated each year to America to escape the economic and political crisis that plagued Galicia and Spain in general. The main port from which all the ships departed was A Coruña, where the naval command was precisely located.\n\nAccording to tradition, this flag was the last one Galician emigrants saw before leaving their land to head to the Americas. They had it so present in their minds that upon arriving at their new destination, they used it to remember the Galicia they left behind.\n\nThe number of crosses on the Galician coat of arms has also varied over the centuries. Historical illustrations show the presence of many more crosses, six or indeterminate numbers. However, the coat of arms with seven crosses eventually prevailed in memory of the ancient provinces of Galicia: Santiago, Betanzos, Mondoñedo, Tui, Lugo, Ourense, and A Coruña.", "isnew": "", "links": "https://www.elidealgallego.com/texto-diario/mostrar/2330862/origenes-bandera-galicia-escudo-gallego"}, {"couname":"[ESP] La Rioja","year":"1982 ","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_YEL","cl_WHI","cl_GRE","cl_BLU"],"Items":["4+Colo","words2","lets07","startL","4+Band","Crosse","Horizo","Animal","Center","Wavess","Geogrh","Builds","Crowns","Waters","NO_BLA","001RED","003YEL","myrEQ","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Flag_of_La_Rioja_%28with_coat_of_arms%29.svg/640px-Flag_of_La_Rioja_%28with_coat_of_arms%29.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Flag_of_La_Rioja_%28with_coat_of_arms%29.svg/2560px-Flag_of_La_Rioja_%28with_coat_of_arms%29.svg.png","type":"Autonomous Community", "describe": "\nThe official meaning of the colors is given as:\n • Red: wine\n • White: river, sky\n • Green: fields, orchards, mountains, forests\n • Yellow: lands, monuments", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_La_Rioja"}, {"couname":"[ESP] Murcia","year":"1983 ","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_YEL"],"Items":["2Color","lets06","startM","NoBand","Builds","Crowns","NO_BLU","NO_WHI","NO_GRE","NO_BLA","WHGRNO","BAWHNO","BLWHNO","WHRENO","myrRED","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Flag_of_the_Region_of_Murcia.svg/640px-Flag_of_the_Region_of_Murcia.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Flag_of_the_Region_of_Murcia.svg/2560px-Flag_of_the_Region_of_Murcia.svg.png","type":"Autonomous Community", "describe": "\nThe four castles evoke the region's history as a frontier zone caught between the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile, and the Nasrid Emirate of Granada and the Mediterranean Sea: four territories of land and sea, Christians and Muslims, adventurers and warriors, all of which created a distinct Murcian culture.

Council Members voted in favour of the version of Rēzekne’s coat of arms that was used during the first period of Latvia’s independence.\nAs several coats of arms previously used by local communities did not correspond to the idea of an independent country, in 1923 a special heraldry commission was established in Latvia. At that time, the official symbol of Latgale was a griffin (facing the left side) that is holding a sword. The same griffin (representing the wish to be considered as the heart and the capital city of Latgale) was placed in the centre of the Rēzekne city coat of arms adopted in 1925. It features a golden (yellow) griffin, an ancient mythological creature with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle, on a sky-blue background.\nAs a matter of fact, according to heraldry regulations, the griffin should be depicted holding a sword, but in the coat of arms of Rēzekne the sword was replaced with a shield in the colours of the Latvian national flag, thus emphasising that the city belongs to the country.

The new state was formed through an alliance between local Anglo settlers and Native American tribes and the Fredonian flag used a white and red stripe to symbolize the two ethnic/racial groups from which the state was formed. Though this rebellion ultimately failed it served as an inspiration to the later Texas Revolution.\n\nThe idea of the 'lone star' is, in fact, an older symbol predating the flag which was used to symbolize Texans' solidarity in declaring independence from Mexico. A similar lone star was on the 'Burnet Flag', which resembled the flag of the short-lived Republic of West Florida.

In any case, the flag's colours, black and gold, have certainly long been associated with the Welsh saint, even if not always in the form of a symmetrical cross. St David's University College, Lampeter (now the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), founded in 1822, adopted these colours as the 'college colours' in 1888, and the flag of St David continues to be associated with the college and is often flown today in a form defaced to include the cinquefoils of the crest of St Davids College.", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Saint_David"}, {"couname":"[ZIM] Rhodesia","year":"1968","region":"rgn_Africa","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_GRE","cl_RED","cl_YEL","cl_BRO","cl_PUR","cl_WHI"],"Items":["4+Colo","lets08","startR","with_z","3Bands","Vertic","Animal","Plants","Texted","Unequa","Center","Geogrh","NO_BLU","001GRE","002WHI","003GRE","myrGRE","histor","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flag_of_Rhodesia_%281968%E2%80%931979%29.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Rhodesia_%281968%E2%80%931979%29.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flag_of_Rhodesia_%281968%E2%80%931979%29.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Rhodesia_%281968%E2%80%931979%29.svg.png","type":"Historical", "describe": "\nA vertical bicolour triband of green, white and green with the coat of arms of Rhodesia in the centre of the white panel.", "isnew": "", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Rhodesia"}, {"couname":"[·] [ARG] Argentina Vexillology Association","year":"2001","region":"rgn_-","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_WHI"],"Items":["4+Colo","words2","words3","lets36","start[","with_v","with_y","year00","4+Band","Diagon","Vertic","Trside","NO_RED","NO_GRE","NO_YEL","NO_BLA","001BLU","002BLU","003BLU","myrBLU","NoStar"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Bandera_de_AAV.svg/320px-Bandera_de_AAV.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Bandera_de_AAV.svg/640px-Bandera_de_AAV.svg.png","type":"Association", "describe": "\nThe flag of the AAV was adopted in 2001.

His elder son Peter, who had declared the independence of Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Pedro I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Pedro IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Pedro stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started the period of the Liberal Wars.\n\nThe liberals formed a separate government exiled on the Azorean island of Terceira. This government issued two decrees establishing modifications to the national flag. While supporters of usurper King Miguel I still upheld the flag established by João VI, the liberal supporters imposed important changes on it. The background was equally divided along its length into blue (hoist) and white (fly); the armillary sphere (associated with Brazil) was removed and the coat of arms was centred over the colour boundary; and the shield reverted to the 'French type' shape of João V. This new flag configuration was decreed solely for terrestrial use, but a variation of it was used as the national ensign. This ensign differed in the way the colours occupied the background (blue 1⁄3, white 2⁄3) with a consequent positional shift of the arms.\n\nWith the defeat and exile of Miguel in 1834, Queen Maria II returned to the throne and the standard of the victorious side was hoisted in Lisbon as the new national flag. It was in use for 80 years, witnessing the last period of the Portuguese monarchy until its abolition in 1910. Currently this flag is used by Portuguese monarchists. The Independence Day parade of Brazil also presented this flag in the standard marchpast, along with other historical flags of Portugal and Brazil.", "isnew": "www", "links": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Portugal#1830%E2%80%931910"}, {"couname":"[ROU] Székely Land","year":"2004","region":"rgn_Europe","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"Items":["4+Colo","words2","lets11","startS","with_y","with_z","year00","3Bands","Horizo","IsMoon","staYEL","NO_RED","NO_GRE","NO_BLA","001BLU","002YEL","003BLU","myrBLU","histor","HasSta","1Stars"],"Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Flag_of_Szekely_Land.svg/320px-Flag_of_Szekely_Land.svg.png","HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Flag_of_Szekely_Land.svg/800px-Flag_of_Szekely_Land.svg.png","type":"Historical and Ethnographic Area", "describe": "\nThe flag is used by the ethnic Hungarian Székely community of Romania.
