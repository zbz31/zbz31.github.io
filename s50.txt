Council Members voted in favour of the version of Rēzekne’s coat of arms that was used during the first period of Latvia’s independence.\nAs several coats of arms previously used by local communities did not correspond to the idea of an independent country, in 1923 a special heraldry commission was established in Latvia. At that time, the official symbol of Latgale was a griffin (facing the left side) that is holding a sword. The same griffin (representing the wish to be considered as the heart and the capital city of Latgale) was placed in the centre of the Rēzekne city coat of arms adopted in 1925. It features a golden (yellow) griffin, an ancient mythological creature with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle, on a sky-blue background.\nAs a matter of fact, according to heraldry regulations, the griffin should be depicted holding a sword, but in the coat of arms of Rēzekne the sword was replaced with a shield in the colours of the Latvian national flag, thus emphasising that the city belongs to the country. As set out in the heraldry regulations, the sky-blue background stands for magnanimity, honesty, loyalty, and excellence.", links: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_R%C4%93zekne"}, {couname:"[LVA] Riga",year:"1673 ",region:"rgn_Europe",Colors:["cl_BLU","cl_WHI","cl_RED","cl_BLA","cl_BRO"],Items:["4+Colo","startR","2Bands","Crosse","Horizo","Animal","Center","Builds","Crowns","001BLU","003WHI","myrEQ","NoStar"],Flag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_Riga.svg/640px-Flag_of_Riga.svg.png",HDFlag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_Riga.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Riga.svg.png",type:"Capital City", describe: "\nThe two towers symbolize the city's autonomy. \nThe raised gate with lion's head symbolizes the bravery of its citizens.\nTwo crossed black keys symbolizes the patronage of the Pope and the protection of the keys of St. Peter.\nA golden cross and a golden crown symbolizes the subservience to the bishop.\nTwo golden lions on a grey plinth symbolizes the strong foundation of the city and the bravery of its citizens.", links: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Riga"}, {couname:"[LVA] Ventspils",year:"1989 ",region:"rgn_Europe",Colors:["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_YEL","cl_BLA","cl_GRA"],Items:["4+Colo","startV","2Bands","Crosse","Horizo","Vertic","Nordic","ntWHYE","NO_BLU","myrWHI","NoStar"],Flag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Flag_of_Ventspils.svg/640px-Flag_of_Ventspils.svg.png",HDFlag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Flag_of_Ventspils.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Ventspils.svg.png",type:"City", describe: "\nThe cross – it symbolises a settlement as a city of the Livonian Order, like it is the case with cross pattée depicted on the coat of arms of Valmiera and also Riga.

In the Middle Ages the Åland archipelago was a province of Sweden. Ecclesiastically the islands belonged to the diocese of Abo (Turku) in Finland, and so the province was lost to Russia in 1809. The issue was finally settled by the League of Nations in 1921. The islands were to be a part of Finland, but they were to enjoy autonomy.\n\nHowever, a flag was not granted until 1954. Unofficially a blue-yellow-blue triband had been in use from 1922. Several versions existed, the dominating one had equal horizontal bands. Another version had a narrower band of yellow - as when the vertical yellow stripe in the cross on the Swedish flag is taken away.\n\nBlue and yellow were naturally the favourite colours, being both the colours of Sweden and the colours of the provincial coat of arms (a golden deer on blue), Therefore, when preparing a design for adoption in the early 1950s, the favoured design was a Scandinavian cross design of a blue field and a yellow and blue cross - that is, the flag of Sweden with an extra blue cross in the middle. This proposal was rejected by the president of Finland as too similar to the Swedish flag. Alternative designs were the old blue-yellow-blue triband, the flag of Finland with an extra yellow cross in the middle, and a design where a red cross was added to the Swedish pattern.\n\nThe outcome of the process was the adoption of the blue-yellow- red Scandinavian cross design. This flag was first hoisted on the town hall in the provincial capital Mariehamn 3 April 1954. The red colour was controversial at first, because people felt it lacked a local tradition. However, the colours can be said to come from the provincial coat of arms (blue and yellow - also Sweden's colours) and the colours of the coat of arms of Finland (red and yellow). Also, experts in heraldry have found out that at one point a Swedish king hoisted a flag of exactly the same design.", links: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Åland"}, {couname:"Albania",year:"1443, 1912, 1992, 2002 ",region:"rgn_Europe",Colors:["cl_RED","cl_BLA"],Items:["2Color","startA","year00","NoBand","Animal","Bird","Center","NO_BLU","NO_WHI","BLWHNO","WHRENO","myrRED","NoStar"],Flag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png",HDFlag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png",type:"", describe: "\nThe red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle, traditionally the symbol of Albanians, represents the sovereign state of Albania. ", links: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania"}, {couname:"Algeria",year:"1962 ",region:"rgn_Africa",Colors:["cl_RED","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],Items:["3Color","startA","2Bands","Vertic","IsMoon","Center","staRED","NO_BLU","001GRE","003WHI","myrEQ","HasSta","1Stars"],Flag:"https://i.ibb.co/k6GbsFg/Algeria-Flag.png",HDFlag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Algeria.svg.png",type:"", describe: "\nThe flag aims to highlight Algeria's cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements.

However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white panji or pataka (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom's banner in the Kediri era (1042 – c.1222).\n\nRed and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa bilimbi, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.\n\nIt was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called piso gaja dompak against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called Woromporang. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).\n\nIn the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled Gedenkboek 1908-1923 run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia ('Indonesian Association'). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule. It became the flag adopted by the Kesatuan Melayu Muda to symbolise Malay nationalism against European colonialism. Upon Indonesia's declaration of independence on 17 August 1945, it was adopted as the national flag, and has been in use ever since. After Indonesia's independence was recognized, Monaco, which had a similar flag, filed a complaint which was largely ignored.", links: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Indonesia"}, {couname:"Iran",year:"1907 ",region:"rgn_Asia",Colors:["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_GRE"],Items:["3Color","startI","3Bands","Horizo","Plants","Texted","Weapon","Center","NO_BLU","001GRE","002WHI","003RED","myrEQ","NoStar"],Flag:"https://i.ibb.co/GPz0Lx6/Iran-Flag.png",HDFlag:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png",type:"", describe: "\nThe colour scheme of green, white and red symbolise Islam, peace and bravery respectively.
