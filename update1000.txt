Now Finegas had been watching for the Salmon of Knowledge for seven years, but after Fionn joined him as a disciple, the salmon was soon caught. Finegas gave it to Fionn to cook, warning him to eat none of it. As Fionn turned the fish on the fire, he burned his thumb and quickly put his thumb in his mouth to soothe the pain. When Finegas saw Fionn coming with the cooked fish, he knew that something had happened, for Fionn had a special look about him. Finegas questioned him and learned about the burned thumb. He realized that it was Fionn who was destined to eat of the Salmon of Knowledge, not himself. Then he said to the lad who stood by obideiently, �Take the salmon and eat it, Fionn, son of Cumhal, for to you the prophecy is come.� Fionn ate the salmon and became the wisest and bravest of men, with the gift of seeing into the past and into the future.\n\nRob Raeside, 29 August 2012"}, {"couname":"[CAN] Labrador", "describe": "\nThe top white bar represents the snow which colours the culture and lifestyle of Labradorians like no other element.

In 1950, the Kingdom of Mysore was renamed Mysore State when India became a democratic republic, but Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar continued to be the chief head of Mysore State. In 1956, the Reorganisation of States Act on a linguistic basis was passed by the Republic of India, which furthered Mysore State's frontiers. Coastal parts of Mangalore, which previously belonged to Madras Presidency, were incorporated into Mysore State, as well as Kannada-speaking regions of Bombay Presidency and Hyderabad State. In 1974, Mysore State was renamed Karnataka State. Until this point, the flag of the Kingdom of Mysore remained the state's flag, official until 1956, and de facto thereafter, until 1974, alongside the bi-coloured Kannada flag. With the renaming of the state, pro-Kannada movements throughout Karnataka gained pace, during which the bi-colored Kannada flag became more prevalent.\n\nThe Mysore Kingdom flag was oblong and bi-colored: a red strip on the top, symbolizing vermilion, and a maroon strip on the bottom. In the center was inscribed the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Mysore. Some synonymous versions of the flag redact the emblem; the original version, however, comes with it inscribed in the center. The coat of arms bore a mythical two-headed eagle, called Gandabherunda, in Kannada. This emblem itself was an adoption from that of the Vijayanagara Empire. Mysore Kingdom inherited this right after the principality was commissioned in 1399 by Harihara II, anointing Mysore Kingdom's first ruler, Yaduraya Wodeyar, as its ruler.\n\nAfter the state's renaming in 1974, this flag was gradually decommissioned.

Council Members voted in favour of the version of Rēzekne’s coat of arms that was used during the first period of Latvia’s independence.\nAs several coats of arms previously used by local communities did not correspond to the idea of an independent country, in 1923 a special heraldry commission was established in Latvia. At that time, the official symbol of Latgale was a griffin (facing the left side) that is holding a sword. The same griffin (representing the wish to be considered as the heart and the capital city of Latgale) was placed in the centre of the Rēzekne city coat of arms adopted in 1925. It features a golden (yellow) griffin, an ancient mythological creature with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle, on a sky-blue background.\nAs a matter of fact, according to heraldry regulations, the griffin should be depicted holding a sword, but in the coat of arms of Rēzekne the sword was replaced with a shield in the colours of the Latvian national flag, thus emphasising that the city belongs to the country.

His elder son Peter, who had declared the independence of Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Pedro I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Pedro IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Pedro stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started the period of the Liberal Wars.\n\nThe liberals formed a separate government exiled on the Azorean island of Terceira. This government issued two decrees establishing modifications to the national flag. While supporters of usurper King Miguel I still upheld the flag established by João VI, the liberal supporters imposed important changes on it. The background was equally divided along its length into blue (hoist) and white (fly); the armillary sphere (associated with Brazil) was removed and the coat of arms was centred over the colour boundary; and the shield reverted to the 'French type' shape of João V. This new flag configuration was decreed solely for terrestrial use, but a variation of it was used as the national ensign. This ensign differed in the way the colours occupied the background (blue 1⁄3, white 2⁄3) with a consequent positional shift of the arms.\n\nWith the defeat and exile of Miguel in 1834, Queen Maria II returned to the throne and the standard of the victorious side was hoisted in Lisbon as the new national flag. It was in use for 80 years, witnessing the last period of the Portuguese monarchy until its abolition in 1910. Currently this flag is used by Portuguese monarchists.

On the central tower, an angel in black, haloed and holding a stick topped by a cross.\nThe castle represents the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the official residence of the Kings of Majorca, located in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic Islands.\n\n\nThe Palace of La Almudaina, which formed the earliest nucleus of the town of Palma, has been the main residence of the successive rulers of Majorca. Shaped like an irregular rectangle, the palace overlooks the lower town and the bay, constituting a convenient watch post. The palace is surrounded by a thick wall including 14 square towers of the same height but one; the higher tower has been known since the 14th century as the Angel's Tower, for the statue that surmounts it. Designed by the Catalan sculptor Arnau de Camprodón upon request of King James II (1276-1311), the statue represents the Guardian Angel who protected the town and the Kingdom of Majorca. Within the walls are located the Royal premises: the main hall, the king's chapel, dedicated to St. Ann, the queen's apartments, remains of the queen's chapel dedicated to St. John, cellars, and the king and queen's gardens.\nA fortification already existed in the Roman period, but probably of much lesser extent, since the town of Palma had no special significance at the time. Accordingly, no detail on its architecture has been recorded. The historian Guillem Rossell&ocaute; Bordoy (b. 1932) provided evidence that the fortified wall was erected during the Muslim period, at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. At the time, the main fortress, of square shape and protected by thick towers, was located in the south-western corner of the area enclosed by the wall, that is, in the present-day's location of the Angel's Tower.\nOn 2 February 1115, Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer III (1086-1131) assaulted Medina Mayurca, partially destroyed the wall and entered the city. Severely damaged, the palace was rebuilt after the Christians' withdrawal. In the aftermath of the definitive conquest of the island, achieved in 1231, James II ordered in the beginning of the 14th century the revamping and increase of the palace, whose external aspect has been hardly modified since then.\nIn 1960-1970, José F. Conrado led a complete restoration of the palace, re-establishing its medieval aspect by removing accessory buildings erected in subsequent periods.\n[Bartomeu Bestard (official town chronicler). El palacio de la Almudaina. Diario de Palma, 15 June 2008]\n\nIn 1309, King James II commissioned the sculptor Arnau de Camprodón to produce a statue of the Guardian Angel (Gabriel). The statue was to be placed atop a tower of the palace that was being rebuilt on the ruins of the Muslim fortress as the future official residence of the new rulers.\nIn January 2010, the sculptor when to Sineu, a town located in the center of the island, where the king had his palace - subsequently kept as his secondary residence. Documents provide evidence of detailed discussions between the artist and his patron about the design of the angelot. Back to Palma, the sculptor designed the frame of the statue in poplar wood, which he subsequently covered with brass sheets. According to José María Quadrado (1819-1896), the angel bears on the chest a plaque inscribed 'Et verbum caro factum est' (John 1.14,The Word became flesh).\nOnce the sculptor completed the statue, 50 days later than promised, he transported it on a donkey to Sineu. Satisfied, the king ordered it would be placed on the highest tower of the restored palace, soon known as the Angel's Tower. The angel became the symbol of the kings of Majorca. The chapel of the royal palace of Perpignan is also surmounted with an angel. King James III placed an angel as the crest on his knight's helmet, as shown in the first miniature decorating the Palatine Law, a codex issued in 1337.\nThe island's people and institutions maintained the devotion to the Guardian Angel long after the suppression of the kingdom of Majorca. Among the four solemn festivals celebrated in Palma, the festival of the Guardian Angel was the most prized and attended. Organized by the municipality, the festival and procession disappeared in the middle of the 19th century.\n[Bartomeu Bestard (official town chronicler). El Ángel Custodio y los reyes de Mallorca.

The Catalan-Aragonese bars\nNo evidence of any flag proper to Minorca was found; there is, however, significant evidence of the use of the Catalan-Aragonese emblems all along the Christian history of the island.\nThe four-striped flag was present in 1232, when the Moorish rulers of the island plead allegiance to five Catalan knights. The royal emblems were formally imported to the island by Count of Barcelona Alfonso II the Liberal (1285-1291), who conquered the island from the Muslims in 1287. The four-pallet shield was sculpted on several buildings dated from the 14th to the 18th century: the vault of the Moon's Gate in the cathedral, keystones in the old St. Clare convent, the St. Roch Gate in Maó-Mahón, the gate of the St. Francis church in Ciutadella, the coat of arms of the old Universitat General (see 2., below), the entrance of the Town Hall of Alaior, and a keystone in the Town Hall of Ciutadella. Moreover, the governors of Minorca consistently used a four-pallet seal in the 16th and 17th centuries, and probably before; older seals were lost during the Ottoman raids on Maó-Mahón (1536) and Ciutadella (1558).\n\n2. The coat of arms of the Universitat General\nThe Universitat General, located in Ciutadella, was the municipal administration of the island; in the 15th century, it was structured into four secondary universitats, located in Ciutadella, Maó-Mahón, Alaior, and Es Mercadal and Castell de Santa Agueda, which remained subordinated to the Universitat General. This municipal system was maintained until the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe arms of the Universitat General featured a fortified town, represented in three main variants:\n- Seals appended to documents dated 1465 and 1556 feature the first version of the arms, matching the design sculpted in the main staircase of the Town Hall of Ciutadella and in the vault of the Moon's Gate of the cathedral. Confirmed in 1300 by James II, this seal was used until 1558, and subsequently used by Ciutadella as its municipal seal until the late 19th century.\n- The Universitat General and the Ciutadella Universitat Particular used from the 16th to the 18th century the second variant of the arms. Orled by the inscription 'LA UNIVERSITAT DE LA ILLA DE MENORCA', the seal features a tower topped by a staff surmounted by a cross potent and a vane pointing to the right. The tower surmounts a building and is surrounded by a pentagonal wall with a gate in the front and four angle towers leaning towards the central tower. On the left and right are placed to crowned shields of Catalonia-Aragón; the whole design is inscribed in an octagon with curvilinear sides.\n- The seal used in the 19th century transports the perspective horizon of the former version; it was also used by the Ciutadella Health Service.\n\nThe commission concluded that the emblem used during the resettlement of Minorca in 1287 and since the infeudation of the island (1232) was made of four red stripes on a red field. To highlight the island's idiosyncrasy, the commission recommended to add the emblem of the old Universitat General to the four-striped flag to compose the flag of Minorca. The first version of the arms of the Universitat General should be preferred for the sake of seniority; it is, however, already used by the town of Ciutadella, and should be preferred the second variant, which would be specific to the island.\n[La Bandera de l'Illa de Menorca, Minorca Island's Council]\n\nIvan Sache, 25 February 2018\n\nErroneous representations of the flag\nFlag"}, {"couname":"[ESP] Lanzarote", "describe": "\nThe flag of Lanzarote is in proportions 2:3, divided red-blue per bend sinister.
